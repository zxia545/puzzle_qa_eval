{"idx": 1, "title": "The Reve's Puzzle", "content": "The Reve was a wily man and something of a scholar. As Chaucer tells us,\n\"There was no auditor could of him win,\" and \"there could no man bring\nhim in arrear.\" The poet also noticed that \"ever he rode the hindermost\nof the route.\" This he did that he might the better, without\ninterruption, work out the fanciful problems and ideas that passed\nthrough his active brain. When the pilgrims were stopping at a wayside\ntavern, a number of cheeses of varying sizes caught his alert eye; and\ncalling for four stools, he told the company that he would show them a\npuzzle of his own that would keep them amused during their rest. He then\nplaced eight cheeses of graduating sizes on one of the end stools, the\nsmallest cheese being at the top, as clearly shown in the illustration.\n\"This is a riddle,\" quoth he, \"that I did once set before my fellow\ntownsmen at Baldeswell, that is in Norfolk, and, by Saint Joce, there\nwas no man among them that could rede it aright. And yet it is withal\nfull easy, for all that I do desire is that, by the moving of one cheese\nat a time from one stool unto another, ye shall remove all the cheeses to\nthe stool at the other end without ever putting any cheese on one that is\nsmaller than itself. To him that will perform this feat in the least\nnumber of moves that be possible will I give a draught of the best that\nour good host can provide.\" To solve this puzzle in the fewest possible\nmoves, first with 8, then with 10, and afterwards with 21 cheeses, is an\ninteresting recreation.", "answer": "The 8 cheeses can be removed in 33 moves, 10 cheeses in 49 moves, and 21\ncheeses in 321 moves. I will give my general method of solution in the\ncases of 3, 4, and 5 stools.\n\nWrite out the following table to any required length:--\n\n  Stools.      Number of Cheeses.\n\n  3      1  2  3   4   5    6    7      Natural Numbers.\n  4      1  3  6  10  15   21   28      Triangular Numbers.\n  5      1  4 10  20  35   56   84      Triangular Pyramids.\n\n         Number of Moves.\n\n  3      1  3  7  15  31   63  127\n  4      1  5 17  49 129  321  769\n  5      1  7 31 111 351 1023 2815\n\nThe first row contains the natural numbers. The second row is found by\nadding the natural numbers together from the beginning. The numbers in\nthe third row are obtained by adding together the numbers in the second\nrow from the beginning. The fourth row contains the successive powers of\n2, less 1. The next series is found by doubling in turn each number of\nthat series and adding the number that stands above the place where you\nwrite the result. The last row is obtained in the same way. This table\nwill at once give solutions for any number of cheeses with three stools,\nfor triangular numbers with four stools, and for pyramidal numbers with\nfive stools. In these cases there is always only one method of\nsolution--that is, of piling the cheeses.\n\nIn the case of three stools, the first and fourth rows tell us that 4\ncheeses may be removed in 15 moves, 5 in 31, 7 in 127. The second and\nfifth rows show that, with four stools, 10 may be removed in 49, and 21\nin 321 moves. Also, with five stools, we find from the third and sixth\nrows that 20 cheeses require 111 moves, and 35 cheeses 351 moves. But we\nalso learn from the table the necessary method of piling. Thus, with four\nstools and 10 cheeses, the previous column shows that we must make piles\nof 6 and 3, which will take 17 and 7 moves respectively--that is, we\nfirst pile the six smallest cheeses in 17 moves on one stool; then we\npile the next 3 cheeses on another stool in 7 moves; then remove the\nlargest cheese in 1 move; then replace the 3 in 7 moves; and finally\nreplace the 6 in 17: making in all the necessary 49 moves. Similarly we\nare told that with five stools 35 cheeses must form piles of 20, 10, and\n4, which will respectively take 111, 49, and 15 moves.\n\nIf the number of cheeses in the case of four stools is not triangular,\nand in the case of five stools pyramidal, then there will be more than\none way of making the piles, and subsidiary tables will be required. This\nis the case with the Reve's 8 cheeses. But I will leave the reader to\nwork out for himself the extension of the problem."}

Pray show how it is possible for me to put\na true pint into each of the measures.\" Of course, no other vessel or\narticle is to be used, and no marking of the measures is allowed. It is a\nknotty little problem and a fascinating one. A good many persons to-day\nwill find it by no means an easy task.

Yet it is but a simple matter for me to put a true\npint of fine old ale in each of these two measures, albeit one is of five\npints and the other of three pints, without using any other measure\nwhatever.\"\n\nThe host of the \"Tabard\" Inn thereupon proceeded to explain to the\npilgrims how this apparently impossible task could be done. He first\nfilled the 5-pint and 3-pint measures, and then, turning the tap, allowed\nthe barrel to run to waste--a proceeding against which the company\nprotested; but the wily man showed that he was aware that the cask did\nnot contain much more than eight pints of ale. The contents, however, do\nnot affect the solution of the puzzle. He then closed the tap and emptied\nthe 3-pint into the barrel; filled the 3-pint from the 5-pint; emptied\nthe 3-pint into the barrel; transferred the two pints from the 5-pint to\nthe 3-pint; filled the 5-pint from the barrel, leaving one pint now in\nthe barrel; filled 3-pint from 5-pint; allowed the company to drink the\ncontents of the 3-pint; filled the 3-pint from the 5-pint, leaving one\npint now in the 5-pint; drank the contents of the 3-pint; and finally\ndrew off one pint from the barrel into the 3-pint.

{"idx": 9, "title": "The Carpenter's Puzzle", "content": "The Carpenter produced the carved wooden pillar that he is seen holding\nin the illustration, wherein the knight is propounding his knotty problem\nto the goodly company (No. 4), and spoke as follows: \"There dwelleth in\nthe city of London a certain scholar that is learned in astrology and\nother strange arts. Some few days gone he did bring unto me a piece of\nwood that had three feet in length, one foot in breadth and one foot in\ndepth, and did desire that it be carved and made into the pillar that you\ndo now behold.

Of a truth I\nhave therefore cut away one cubic foot (which is to say one-third) of the\nthree cubic feet of the block; but this scholar withal doth hold that\npayment may not thus be fairly made by weight, since the heart of the\nblock may be heavier, or perchance may be more light, than the outside.\nHow then may I with ease satisfy the scholar as to the quantity of wood\nthat hath been cut away?\" This at first sight looks a difficult question,\nbut it is so absurdly simple that the method employed by the carpenter\nshould be known to everybody to-day, for it is a very useful little\n\"wrinkle.\"", "answer": "The carpenter said that he made a box whose internal dimensions were\nexactly the same as the original block of wood--that is, 3 feet by 1 foot\nby 1 foot. He then placed the carved pillar in this box and filled up all\nthe vacant space with a fine, dry sand, which he carefully shook down\nuntil he could get no more into the box. Then he removed the pillar,\ntaking great care not to lose any of the sand, which, on being shaken\ndown alone in the box, filled a space equal to one cubic foot.

{"idx": 12, "title": "The Merchant's Puzzle", "content": "Of the Merchant the poet writes, \"Forsooth he was a worthy man withal.\"\nHe was thoughtful, full of schemes, and a good manipulator of figures.\n\"His reasons spake he eke full solemnly. Sounding away the increase of\nhis winning.\" One morning, when they were on the road, the Knight and the\nSquire, who were riding beside him, reminded the Merchant that he had not\nyet propounded the puzzle that he owed the company. He thereupon said,\n\"Be it so? Here then is a riddle in numbers that I will set before this\nmerry company when next we do make a halt. There be thirty of us in all\nriding over the common this morn. Truly we may ride one and one, in what\nthey do call the single file, or two and two, or three and three, or five\nand five, or six and six, or ten and ten, or fifteen and fifteen, or all\nthirty in a row. In no other way may we ride so that there be no lack of\nequal numbers in the rows. Now, a party of pilgrims were able thus to\nride in as many as sixty-four different ways. Prithee tell me how many\nthere must perforce have been in the company.\" The Merchant clearly\nrequired the smallest number of persons that could so ride in the\nsixty-four ways.", "answer": "This puzzle amounts to finding the smallest possible number that has\nexactly sixty-four divisors, counting 1 and the number itself as\ndivisors. The least number is 7,560. The pilgrims might, therefore, have\nridden in single file, two and two, three and three, four and four, and\nso on, in exactly sixty-four different ways, the last manner being in a\nsingle row of 7,560.\n\nThe Merchant was careful to say that they were going over a common, and\nnot to mention its size, for it certainly would not be possible along an\nordinary road!\n\nTo find how many different numbers will divide a given number, N, let N =\n_a_^p _b_^q _c_^r ..., where _a_, _b_, _c_ ... are prime numbers. Then\nthe number of divisors will be (_p_ + 1) (_q_ + 1) (_r_ + 1) ..., which\nincludes as divisors 1 and N itself. Thus in the case of my puzzle--\n\n  7,560  =  2^3 × 3^3 × 5 × 7\n  Powers =  3     3     1   1\n  Therefore 4   × 4   × 2 × 2 = 64 divisors.\n\nTo find the smallest number that has a given number of divisors we must\nproceed by trial. But it is important sometimes to note whether or not\nthe condition is that there shall be a given number of divisors _and no\nmore_. For example, the smallest number that has seven divisors and no\nmore is 64, while 24 has eight divisors, and might equally fulfil the\nconditions. The stipulation as to \"no more\" was not necessary in the case\nof my puzzle, for no smaller number has more than sixty-four divisors."}
{"idx": 15, "title": "The Cook's Puzzle", "content": "We find that there was a cook among the company; and his services were no\ndoubt at times in great request, \"For he could roast and seethe, and\nbroil and fry, And make a mortress and well bake a pie.\" One night when\nthe pilgrims were seated at a country hostelry, about to begin their\nrepast, the cook presented himself at the head of the table that was\npresided over by the Franklin, and said, \"Listen awhile, my masters,\nwhile that I do ask ye a riddle, and by Saint Moden it is one that I\ncannot answer myself withal.

In the midst of their deep\nthinking and hot dispute what should the cunning knave do but stealthily\ntake away both the pie and the pasty. Then, when hunger made them desire\nto go on with the repast, finding there was nought upon the table, they\ncalled clamorously for the cook.\n\n\"My masters,\" he explained, \"seeing you were so deep set in the riddle, I\ndid take them to the next room, where others did eat them with relish ere\nthey had grown cold. There be excellent bread and cheese in the pantry.\"", "answer": "There were four portions of warden pie and four portions of venison pasty\nto be distributed among eight out of eleven guests.

The Sompnour suggested that they should draw lots, and as he had\nhad experience in such matters in the summoning of juries and in other\nways, he arranged the company in a circle and proposed a \"count out.\"\nBeing of a chivalrous nature, his little plot was so to arrange that the\nmen should all fall out and leave the ladies in possession.

The count then began afresh\nat the next person. But the lady misunderstood her instructions, and\nselected in mistake the number eleven and started the count at herself.\nAs will be found, this resulted in all the women falling out in turn\ninstead of the men, for every eleventh person withdrawn from the circle\nis a lady.\n\n\"Of a truth it was no fault of mine,\" said the Sompnour next day to the\ncompany, \"and herein is methinks a riddle.

Our text-books tell us that all\nspheres are similar, and that similar solids are as the cubes of\ncorresponding lengths. Therefore, as the circumferences of the two phials\nwere one foot and two feet respectively and the cubes of one and two\nadded together make nine, what we have to find is two other numbers whose\ncubes added together make nine. These numbers clearly must be fractional.\nNow, this little question has really engaged the attention of learned men\nfor two hundred and fifty years; but although Peter de Fermat showed in\nthe seventeenth century how an answer may be found in two fractions with\na denominator of no fewer than twenty-one figures, not only are all the\npublished answers, by his method, that I have seen inaccurate, but nobody\nhas ever published the much smaller result that I now print.

That this was not prohibited we shall soon find. Though the\nplan showed all the bridges in his parish, it only showed \"part of\" the\nparish itself. It is not stated that the river did not take its rise in\nthe parish, and since it leads to the only possible solution, we must\nassume that it did. The answer would be, therefore, as shown. It should\nbe noted that we are clearly prevented from considering the possibility\nof getting round the mouth of the river, because we are told it \"joined\nthe sea some hundred miles to the south,\" while no parish ever extended a\nhundred miles!"}
{"idx": 26, "title": "The Haberdasher's Puzzle", "content": "Many attempts were made to induce the Haberdasher, who was of the party,\nto propound a puzzle of some kind, but for a long time without success.\nAt last, at one of the Pilgrims' stopping-places, he said that he would\nshow them something that would \"put their brains into a twist like unto a\nbell-rope.\" As a matter of fact, he was really playing off a practical\njoke on the company, for he was quite ignorant of any answer to the\npuzzle that he set them. He produced a piece of cloth in the shape of a\nperfect equilateral triangle, as shown in the illustration, and said, \"Be\nthere any among ye full wise in the true cutting of cloth? I trow not.\nEvery man to his trade, and the scholar may learn from the varlet and the\nwise man from the fool. Show me, then, if ye can, in what manner this\npiece of cloth may be cut into four several pieces that may be put\ntogether to make a perfect square.\"\n\nNow some of the more learned of the company found a way of doing it in\nfive pieces, but not in four. But when they pressed the Haberdasher for\nthe correct answer he was forced to admit, after much beating about the\nbush, that he knew no way of doing it in any number of pieces. \"By Saint\nFrancis,\" saith he, \"any knave can make a riddle methinks, but it is for\nthem that may to rede it aright.\" For this he narrowly escaped a sound\nbeating. But the curious point of the puzzle is that I have found that\nthe feat may really be performed in so few as four pieces, and without\nturning over any piece when placing them together. The method of doing\nthis is subtle, but I think the reader will find the problem a most\ninteresting one.", "answer": "The illustration will show how the triangular piece of cloth may be cut\ninto four pieces that will fit together and form a perfect square. Bisect\nAB in D and BC in E; produce the line AE to F making EF equal to EB;\nbisect AF in G and describe the arc AHF; produce EB to H, and EH is the\nlength of the side of the required square; from E with distance EH,\ndescribe the arc HJ, and make JK equal to BE; now, from the points D and\nK drop perpendiculars on EJ at L and M. If you have done this accurately,\nyou will now have the required directions for the cuts.\nI exhibited this problem before the Royal Society, at Burlington House,\non 17th May 1905, and also at the Royal Institution in the following\nmonth, in the more general form:--\"A New Problem on Superposition: a\ndemonstration that an equilateral triangle can be cut into four pieces\nthat may be reassembled to form a square, with some examples of a general\nmethod for transforming all rectilinear triangles into squares by\ndissection.\" It was also issued as a challenge to the readers of the\n_Daily Mail_ (see issues of 1st and 8th February 1905), but though many\nhundreds of attempts were sent in there was not a single solver. Credit,\nhowever, is due to Mr. C. W. M'Elroy, who alone sent me the correct\nsolution when I first published the problem in the _Weekly Dispatch_ in\n1902.\n\nI add an illustration showing the puzzle in a rather curious practical\nform, as it was made in polished mahogany with brass hinges for use by\ncertain audiences. It will be seen that the four pieces form a sort of\nchain, and that when they are closed up in one direction they form the\ntriangle, and when closed in the other direction they form the square."}
{"idx": 27, "title": "The Dyer's Puzzle", "content": "One of the pilgrims was a Dyer, but Chaucer tells us nothing about him,\nthe Tales being incomplete. Time after time the company had pressed this\nindividual to produce a puzzle of some kind, but without effect. The poor\nfellow tried his best to follow the examples of his friends the Tapiser,\nthe Weaver, and the Haberdasher; but the necessary idea would not come,\nrack his brains as he would. All things, however, come to those who\nwait--and persevere--and one morning he announced, in a state of\nconsiderable excitement, that he had a poser to set before them. He\nbrought out a square piece of silk on which were embroidered a number of\nfleurs-de-lys in rows, as shown in our illustration.\n\n\"Lordings,\" said the Dyer, \"hearken anon unto my riddle. Since I was\nawakened at dawn by the crowing of cocks--for which din may our host\nnever thrive--I have sought an answer thereto, but by St. Bernard I have\nfound it not. There be sixty-and-four flowers-de-luce, and the riddle is\nto show how I may remove six of these so that there may yet be an even\nnumber of the flowers in every row and every column.\"\nThe Dyer was abashed when every one of the company showed without any\ndifficulty whatever, and each in a different way, how this might be done.\nBut the good Clerk of Oxenford was seen to whisper something to the Dyer,\nwho added, \"Hold, my masters! What I have said is not all. Ye must find\nin how many different ways it may be done!\" All agreed that this was\nquite another matter. And only a few of the company got the right answer.", "answer": "The correct answer is 18,816 different ways. The general formula for six\nfleurs-de-lys for all squares greater than 2^{2} is simply this: Six\ntimes the square of the number of combinations of _n_ things, taken three\nat a time, where _n_ represents the number of fleurs-de-lys in the side\nof the square. Of course where _n_ is even the remainders in rows and\ncolumns will be even, and where _n_ is odd the remainders will be odd.\n\nFor further solution, see No. 358 in _A. in M._"}
{"idx": 29, "title": "Chaucer's Puzzle", "content": "Chaucer himself accompanied the pilgrims. Being a mathematician and a man\nof a thoughtful habit, the Host made fun of him, he tells us, saying,\n\"Thou lookest as thou wouldst find a hare, For ever on the ground I see\nthee stare.\" The poet replied to the request for a tale by launching into\na long-spun-out and ridiculous poem, intended to ridicule the popular\nromances of the day, after twenty-two stanzas of which the company\nrefused to hear any more, and induced him to start another tale in prose.\nIt is an interesting fact that in the \"Parson's Prologue\" Chaucer\nactually introduces a little astronomical problem. In modern English\nthis reads somewhat as follows:--\n\n\"The sun from the south line was descended so low that it was not to my\nsight more than twenty-nine degrees. I calculate that it was four\no'clock, for, assuming my height to be six feet, my shadow was eleven\nfeet, a little more or less. At the same moment the moon's altitude (she\nbeing in mid-Libra) was steadily increasing as we entered at the west end\nof the village.\" A correspondent has taken the trouble to work this out,\nand finds that the local time was 3.58 p.m., correct to a minute, and\nthat the day of the year was the 22nd or 23rd of April, modern style.\nThis speaks well for Chaucer's accuracy, for the first line of the Tales\ntells us that the pilgrimage was in April--they are supposed to have set\nout on 17th April 1387, as stated in No. 23.\n\nThough Chaucer made this little puzzle and recorded it for the interest\nof his readers, he did not venture to propound it to his fellow-pilgrims.\nThe puzzle that he gave them was of a simpler kind altogether: it may be\ncalled a geographical one. \"When, in the year 1372, I did go into Italy\nas the envoy of our sovereign lord King Edward the Third, and while there\ndid visit Francesco Petrarch, that learned poet did take me to the top of\na certain mountain in his country. Of a truth, as he did show me, a mug\nwill hold less liquor at the top of this mountain than in the valley\nbeneath. Prythee tell me what mountain this may be that has so strange a\nproperty withal.\" A very elementary knowledge of geography will suffice\nfor arriving at the correct answer.", "answer": "The surface of water or other liquid is always spherical, and the greater\nany sphere is the less is its convexity. Hence the top diameter of any\nvessel at the summit of a mountain will form the base of the segment of a\ngreater sphere than it would at the bottom. This sphere, being greater,\nmust (from what has been already said) be less convex; or, in other\nwords, the spherical surface of the water must be less above the brim of\nthe vessel, and consequently it will hold less at the top of a mountain\nthan at the bottom. The reader is therefore free to select any mountain\nhe likes in Italy--or elsewhere!"}
{"idx": 31, "title": "The Manciple's Puzzle", "content": "The Manciple was an officer who had the care of buying victuals for an\nInn of Court--like the Temple. The particular individual who accompanied\nthe party was a wily man who had more than thirty masters, and made fools\nof them all. Yet he was a man \"whom purchasers might take as an example\nHow to be wise in buying of their victual.\"\n\nIt happened that at a certain stage of the journey the Miller and the\nWeaver sat down to a light repast. The Miller produced five loaves and\nthe Weaver three. The Manciple coming upon the scene asked permission to\neat with them, to which they agreed. When the Manciple had fed he laid\ndown eight pieces of money and said with a sly smile, \"Settle betwixt\nyourselves how the money shall be fairly divided. 'Tis a riddle for thy\nwits.\"\n\nA discussion followed, and many of the pilgrims joined in it. The Reve\nand the Sompnour held that the Miller should receive five pieces and the\nWeaver three, the simple Ploughman was ridiculed for suggesting that the\nMiller should receive seven and the Weaver only one, while the Carpenter,\nthe Monk, and the Cook insisted that the money should be divided equally\nbetween the two men. Various other opinions were urged with considerable\nvigour, until it was finally decided that the Manciple, as an expert in\nsuch matters, should himself settle the point. His decision was quite\ncorrect. What was it? Of course, all three are supposed to have eaten\nequal shares of the bread.\nPUZZLING TIMES AT SOLVAMHALL CASTLE\nEverybody that has heard of Solvamhall Castle, and of the quaint customs\nand ceremonies that obtained there in the olden times, is familiar with\nthe fact that Sir Hugh de Fortibus was a lover of all kinds of puzzles\nand enigmas. Sir Robert de Riddlesdale himself declared on one occasion,\n\"By the bones of Saint Jingo, this Sir Hugh hath a sharp wit. Certes, I\nwot not the riddle that he may not rede withal.\" It is, therefore, a\nsource of particular satisfaction that the recent discovery of some\nancient rolls and documents relating mainly to the family of De Fortibus\nenables me to place before my readers a few of the posers that racked\npeople's brains in the good old days. The selection has been made to suit\nall tastes, and while the majority will be found sufficiently easy to\ninterest those who like a puzzle that _is_ a puzzle, but well within the\nscope of all, two that I have included may perhaps be found worthy of\nengaging the attention of the more advanced student of these things.", "answer": "The simple Ploughman, who was so ridiculed for his opinion, was perfectly\ncorrect: the Miller should receive seven pieces of money, and the Weaver\nonly one. As all three ate equal shares of the bread, it should be\nevident that each ate 8/3 of a loaf. Therefore, as the Miller provided\n15/3 and ate 8/3, he contributed 7/3 to the Manciple's meal; whereas the\nWeaver provided 9/3, ate 8/3, and contributed only 1/3. Therefore, since\nthey contributed to the Manciple in the proportion of 7 to 1, they must\ndivide the eight pieces of money in the same proportion.\n\nPUZZLING TIMES AT SOLVAMHALL CASTLE\n\n_SIR HUGH EXPLAINS HIS PROBLEMS_\n\nThe friends of Sir Hugh de Fortibus were so perplexed over many of his\nstrange puzzles that at a gathering of his kinsmen and retainers he\nundertook to explain his posers.\n\"Of a truth,\" said he, \"some of the riddles that I have put forth would\ngreatly tax the wit of the unlettered knave to rede; yet will I try to\nshow the manner thereof in such way that all may have understanding.

{"idx": 32, "title": "The Game of Bandy-Ball", "content": "Bandy-ball, cambuc, or goff (the game so well known to-day by the name of\ngolf), is of great antiquity, and was a special favourite at Solvamhall\nCastle. Sir Hugh de Fortibus was himself a master of the game, and he\nonce proposed this question.\n\nThey had nine holes, 300, 250, 200, 325, 275, 350, 225, 375, and 400\nyards apart. If a man could always strike the ball in a perfectly\nstraight line and send it exactly one of two distances, so that it would\neither go towards the hole, pass over it, or drop into it, what would the\ntwo distances be that would carry him in the least number of strokes\nround the whole course?\n\n\"Beshrew me,\" Sir Hugh would say, \"if I know any who could do it in this\nperfect way; albeit, the point is a pretty one.\"\n\nTwo very good distances are 125 and 75, which carry you round in 28\nstrokes, but this is not the correct answer. Can the reader get round in\nfewer strokes with two other distances?", "answer": "Sir Hugh explained, in answer to this puzzle, that as the nine holes were\n300, 250, 200, 325, 275, 350, 225, 375, and 400 yards apart, if a man\ncould always strike the ball in a perfectly straight line and send it at\nwill a distance of either 125 yards or 100 yards, he might go round the\nwhole course in 26 strokes. This is clearly correct, for if we call the\n125 stroke the \"drive\" and the 100 stroke the \"approach,\" he could play\nas follows:--The first hole could be reached in 3 approaches, the second\nin 2 drives, the third in 2 approaches, the fourth in 2 approaches and 1\ndrive, the fifth in 3 drives and 1 backward approach, the sixth in 2\ndrives and 1 approach, the seventh in 1 drive and 1 approach, the eighth\nin 3 drives, and the ninth hole in 4 approaches. There are thus 26\nstrokes in all, and the feat cannot be performed in fewer."}
{"idx": 33, "title": "Tilting at the Ring", "content": "Another favourite sport at the castle was tilting at the ring. A\nhorizontal bar was fixed in a post, and at the end of a hanging supporter\nwas placed a circular ring, as shown in the above illustrated title. By\nraising or lowering the bar the ring could be adjusted to the proper\nheight--generally about the level of the left eyebrow of the horseman.\nThe object was to ride swiftly some eighty paces and run the lance\nthrough the ring, which was easily detached, and remained on the lance as\nthe property of the skilful winner. It was a very difficult feat, and men\nwere not unnaturally proud of the rings they had succeeded in capturing.\n\nAt one tournament at the castle Henry de Gournay beat Stephen Malet by\nsix rings. Each had his rings made into a chain--De Gournay's chain being\nexactly sixteen inches in length, and Malet's six inches. Now, as the\nrings were all of the same size and made of metal half an inch thick, the\nlittle puzzle proposed by Sir Hugh was to discover just how many rings\neach man had won.", "answer": "\"By my halidame!\" exclaimed Sir Hugh, \"if some of yon varlets had been\nput in chains, which for their sins they do truly deserve, then would\nthey well know, mayhap, that the length of any chain having like rings is\nequal to the inner width of a ring multiplied by the number of rings and\nadded to twice the thickness of the iron whereof it is made. It may be\nshown that the inner width of the rings used in the tilting was one inch\nand two-thirds thereof, and the number of rings Stephen Malet did win\nwas three, and those that fell to Henry de Gournay would be nine.\"\n\nThe knight was quite correct, for 1-2/3 in. × 3 + 1 in. = 6 in., and\n1-2/3 in. x 9 + 1 in. = 16 in. Thus De Gournay beat Malet by six rings.\nThe drawing showing the rings may assist the reader in verifying the\nanswer and help him to see why the inner width of a link multiplied by\nthe number of links and added to twice the thickness of the iron gives\nthe exact length. It will be noticed that every link put on the chain\nloses a length equal to twice the thickness of the iron."}
{"idx": 36, "title": "The Donjon Keep Window", "content": "On one occasion Sir Hugh greatly perplexed his chief builder. He took\nthis worthy man to the walls of the donjon keep and pointed to a window\nthere.\n\n\"Methinks,\" said he, \"yon window is square, and measures, on the inside,\none foot every way, and is divided by the narrow bars into four lights,\nmeasuring half a foot on every side.\"\n\n\"Of a truth that is so, Sir Hugh.\"\n\"Then I desire that another window be made higher up whose four sides\nshall also be each one foot, but it shall be divided by bars into eight\nlights, whose sides shall be all equal.\"\n\n\"Truly, Sir Hugh,\" said the bewildered chief builder, \"I know not how it\nmay be done.\"\n\n\"By my halidame!\" exclaimed De Fortibus in pretended rage, \"let it be\ndone forthwith. I trow thou art but a sorry craftsman if thou canst not,\nforsooth, set such a window in a keep wall.\"\n\nIt will be noticed that Sir Hugh ignores the thickness of the bars.", "answer": "In this case Sir Hugh had greatly perplexed his chief builder by\ndemanding that he should make a window measuring one foot on every side\nand divided by bars into eight lights, having all their sides equal. The\nillustration will show how this was to be done. It will be seen that if\neach side of the window measures one foot, then each of the eight\ntriangular lights is six inches on every side.\n\n\"Of a truth, master builder,\" said De Fortibus slyly to the architect, \"I\ndid not tell thee that the window must be square, as it is most certain\nit never could be.\""}
{"idx": 39, "title": "The Snail on the Flagstaff", "content": "It would often be interesting if we could trace back to their origin many\nof the best known puzzles. Some of them would be found to have been first\npropounded in very ancient times, and there can be very little doubt that\nwhile a certain number may have improved with age, others will have\ndeteriorated and even lost their original point and bearing. It is\ncurious to find in the Solvamhall records our familiar friend the\nclimbing snail puzzle, and it will be seen that in its modern form it has\nlost its original subtlety.\nOn the occasion of some great rejoicings at the Castle, Sir Hugh was\nsuperintending the flying of flags and banners, when somebody pointed out\nthat a wandering snail was climbing up the flagstaff. One wise old fellow\nsaid:--\n\n\"They do say, Sir Knight, albeit I hold such stories as mere fables, that\nthe snail doth climb upwards three feet in the daytime, but slippeth back\ntwo feet by night.\"\n\"Then,\" replied Sir Hugh, \"tell us how many days it will take this snail\nto get from the bottom to the top of the pole.\"\n\n\"By bread and water, I much marvel if the same can be done unless we take\ndown and measure the staff.\"\n\n\"Credit me,\" replied the knight, \"there is no need to measure the staff.\"\n\nCan the reader give the answer to this version of a puzzle that we all\nknow so well?", "answer": "Though there was no need to take down and measure the staff, it is\nundoubtedly necessary to find its height before the answer can be given.\nIt was well known among the friends and retainers of Sir Hugh de Fortibus\nthat he was exactly six feet in height. It will be seen in the original\npicture that Sir Hugh's height is just twice the length of his shadow.\nTherefore we all know that the flagstaff will, at the same place and time\nof day, be also just twice as long as its shadow. The shadow of the staff\nis the same length as Sir Hugh's height; therefore this shadow is six\nfeet long, and the flagstaff must be twelve feet high. Now, the snail, by\nclimbing up three feet in the daytime and slipping back two feet by\nnight, really advances one foot in a day of twenty-four hours. At the end\nof nine days it is three feet from the top, so that it reaches its\njourney's end on the tenth day.\n\nThe reader will doubtless here exclaim, \"This is all very well; but how\nwere we to know the height of Sir Hugh? It was never stated how tall he\nwas!\" No, it was not stated in so many words, but it was none the less\nclearly indicated to the reader who is sharp in these matters. In the\noriginal illustration to the donjon keep window Sir Hugh is shown\nstanding against a wall, the window in which is stated to be one foot\nsquare on the inside. Therefore, as his height will be found by\nmeasurement to be just six times the inside height of the window, he\nevidently stands just six feet in his boots!"}
{"idx": 40, "title": "Lady Isabel's Casket", "content": "Sir Hugh's young kinswoman and ward, Lady Isabel de Fitzarnulph, was\nknown far and wide as \"Isabel the Fair.\" Amongst her treasures was a\ncasket, the top of which was perfectly square in shape. It was inlaid\nwith pieces of wood, and a strip of gold ten inches long by a quarter of\nan inch wide.\n\nWhen young men sued for the hand of Lady Isabel, Sir Hugh promised his\nconsent to the one who would tell him the dimensions of the top of the\nbox from these facts alone: that there was a rectangular strip of gold,\nten inches by 1/4-inch; and the rest of the surface was exactly inlaid\nwith pieces of wood, each piece being a perfect square, and no two pieces\nof the same size. Many young men failed, but one at length succeeded. The\npuzzle is not an easy one, but the dimensions of that strip of gold,\ncombined with those other conditions, absolutely determine the size of\nthe top of the casket.\n\nTHE MERRY MONKS OF RIDDLEWELL\n\nTHEIR QUAINT PUZZLES AND ENIGMAS.\n\"Friar Andrew,\" quoth the Lord Abbot, as he lay a-dying, \"methinks I\ncould now rede thee the riddle of riddles--an I had--the time--and--\" The\ngood friar put his ear close to the holy Abbot's lips, but alas! they\nwere silenced for ever. Thus passed away the life of the jovial and\ngreatly beloved Abbot of the old monastery of Riddlewell.\n\nThe monks of Riddlewell Abbey were noted in their day for the quaint\nenigmas and puzzles that they were in the habit of propounding. The Abbey\nwas built in the fourteenth century, near a sacred spring known as the\nRed-hill Well. This became in the vernacular Reddlewell and Riddlewell,\nand under the Lord Abbot David the monks evidently tried to justify the\nlatter form by the riddles they propounded so well. The solving of\npuzzles became the favourite recreation, no matter whether they happened\nto be of a metaphysical, philosophical, mathematical, or mechanical kind.\nIt grew into an absorbing passion with them, and as I have shown above,\nin the case of the Abbot this passion was strong even in death.\n\nIt would seem that the words \"puzzle,\" \"problem,\" \"enigma,\" etc., did not\noccur in their vocabulary. They were accustomed to call every poser a\n\"riddle,\" no matter whether it took the form of \"Where was Moses when the\nlight went out?\" or the Squaring of the Circle. On one of the walls in\nthe refectory were inscribed the words of Samson, \"I will now put forth\na riddle to you,\" to remind the brethren of what was expected of them,\nand the rule was that each monk in turn should propose some riddle weekly\nto the community, the others being always free to cap it with another if\ndisposed to do so. Abbot David was, undoubtedly, the puzzle genius of the\nmonastery, and everybody naturally bowed to his decision. Only a few of\nthe Abbey riddles have been preserved, and I propose to select those that\nseem most interesting. I shall try to make the conditions of the puzzles\nperfectly clear, so that the modern reader may fully understand them, and\nbe amused in trying to find some of the solutions.", "answer": "The last puzzle was undoubtedly a hard nut, but perhaps difficulty does\nnot make a good puzzle any the less interesting when we are shown the\nsolution. The accompanying diagram indicates exactly how the top of Lady\nIsabel de Fitzarnulph's casket was inlaid with square pieces of rare wood\n(no two squares alike) and the strip of gold 10 inches by a quarter of an\ninch. This is the only possible solution, and it is a singular fact\n(though I cannot here show the subtle method of working) that the number,\nsizes, and order of those squares are determined by the given dimensions\nof the strip of gold, and the casket can have no other dimensions than 20\ninches square. The number in a square indicates the length in inches of\nthe side of that square, so the accuracy of the answer can be checked\nalmost at a glance.\n\nSir Hugh de Fortibus made some general concluding remarks on the occasion\nthat are not altogether uninteresting to-day.\n\"Friends and retainers,\" he said, \"if the strange offspring of my poor\nwit about which we have held pleasant counsel to-night hath mayhap had\nsome small interest for ye, let these matters serve to call to mind the\nlesson that our fleeting life is rounded and beset with enigmas. Whence\nwe came and whither we go be riddles, and albeit such as these we may\nnever bring within our understanding, yet there be many others with which\nwe and they that do come after us will ever strive for the answer.\nWhether success do attend or do not attend our labour, it is well that we\nmake the attempt; for 'tis truly good and honourable to train the mind,\nand the wit, and the fancy of man, for out of such doth issue all manner\nof good in ways unforeseen for them that do come after us.\"\n\nTHE MERRY MONKS OF RIDDLEWELL"}
{"idx": 41, "title": "The Riddle of the Fish-pond", "content": "At the bottom of the Abbey meads was a small fish-pond where the monks\nused to spend many a contemplative hour with rod and line. One day, when\nthey had had very bad luck and only caught twelve fishes amongst them,\nBrother Jonathan suddenly declared that as there was no sport that day\nhe would put forth a riddle for their entertainment. He thereupon took\ntwelve fish baskets and placed them at equal distances round the pond, as\nshown in our illustration, with one fish in each basket.\n\n\"Now, gentle anglers,\" said he, \"rede me this riddle of the Twelve\nFishes. Start at any basket you like, and, always going in one direction\nround the pond, take up one fish, pass it over two other fishes, and\nplace it in the next basket. Go on again; take up another single fish,\nand, having passed that also over two fishes, place it in a basket; and\nso continue your journey. Six fishes only are to be removed, and when\nthese have been placed, there should be two fishes in each of six\nbaskets, and six baskets empty. Which of you merry wights will do this in\nsuch a manner that you shall go round the pond as few times as possible?\"\n\nI will explain to the reader that it does not matter whether the two\nfishes that are passed over are in one or two baskets, nor how many empty\nbaskets you pass. And, as Brother Jonathan said, you must always go in\none direction round the pond (without any doubling back) and end at the\nspot from which you set out.", "answer": "Number the fish baskets in the illustration from 1 to 12 in the direction\nthat Brother Jonathan is seen to be going. Starting from 1, proceed as\nfollows, where \"1 to 4\" means, take the fish from basket No. 1 and\ntransfer it to basket No. 4:--\n\n1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 3 to 6, 7 to 10, 11 to 2, and complete the last\nrevolution to 1, making three revolutions in all. Or you can proceed this\nway:--\n\n4 to 7, 8 to 11, 12 to 3, 2 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 1.\n\nIt is easy to solve in four revolutions, but the solutions in three are\nmore difficult to discover."}
{"idx": 44, "title": "The Riddle of the Sack Wine", "content": "One evening, when seated at table, Brother Benjamin was called upon by\nthe Abbot to give the riddle that was that day demanded of him.\n\n\"Forsooth,\" said he, \"I am no good at the making of riddles, as thou\nknowest full well; but I have been teasing my poor brain over a matter\nthat I trust some among you will expound to me, for I cannot rede it\nmyself. It is this. Mark me take a glass of sack from this bottle that\ncontains a pint of wine and pour it into that jug which contains a pint\nof water. Now, I fill the glass with the mixture from the jug and pour it\nback into the bottle holding the sack. Pray tell me, have I taken more\nwine from the bottle than water from the jug? Or have I taken more water\nfrom the jug than wine from the bottle?\"\n\nI gather that the monks got nearer to a great quarrel over this little\nposer than had ever happened before. One brother so far forgot himself as\nto tell his neighbour that \"more wine had got into his pate than wit came\nout of it,\" while another noisily insisted that it all depended on the\nshape of the glass and the age of the wine. But the Lord Abbot\nintervened, showed them what a simple question it really was, and\nrestored good feeling all round.", "answer": "The question was: Did Brother Benjamin take more wine from the bottle\nthan water from the jug? Or did he take more water from the jug than wine\nfrom the bottle? He did neither. The same quantity of wine was\ntransferred from the bottle as water was taken from the jug. Let us\nassume that the glass would hold a quarter of a pint. There was a pint of\nwine in the bottle and a pint of water in the jug. After the first\nmanipulation the bottle contains three-quarters of a pint of wine, and\nthe jug one pint of water mixed with a quarter of a pint of wine. Now,\nthe second transaction consists in taking away a fifth of the contents of\nthe jug--that is, one-fifth of a pint of water mixed with one-fifth of a\nquarter of a pint of wine. We thus leave behind in the jug four-fifths of\na quarter of a pint of wine--that is, one-fifth of a pint--while we\ntransfer from the jug to the bottle an equal quantity (one-fifth of a\npint) of water."}
{"idx": 45, "title": "The Riddle of the Cellarer", "content": "Then Abbot David looked grave, and said that this incident brought to his\nmind the painful fact that John the Cellarer had been caught robbing the\ncask of best Malvoisie that was reserved for special occasions. He\nordered him to be brought in.\n\"Now, varlet,\" said the Abbot, as the ruddy-faced Cellarer came before\nhim, \"thou knowest that thou wast taken this morning in the act of\nstealing good wine that was forbidden thee. What hast thou to say for\nthyself?\"\n\n\"Prithee, my Lord Abbot, forgive me!\" he cried, falling on his knees. \"Of\na truth, the Evil One did come and tempt me, and the cask was so handy,\nand the wine was so good withal, and--and I had drunk of it ofttimes\nwithout being found out, and--\"\n\n\"Rascal! that but maketh thy fault the worse! How much wine hast thou\ntaken?\"\n\n\"Alack-a-day! There were a hundred pints in the cask at the start, and I\nhave taken me a pint every day this month of June--it being to-day the\nthirtieth thereof--and if my Lord Abbot can tell me to a nicety how much\ngood wine I have taken in all, let him punish me as he will.\"\n\n\"Why, knave, that is thirty pints.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; for each time I drew a pint out of the cask, I put in a pint\nof water in its stead!\"\n\nIt is a curious fact that this is the only riddle in the old record that\nis not accompanied by its solution. Is it possible that it proved too\nhard a nut for the monks? There is merely the note, \"John suffered no\npunishment for his sad fault.\"", "answer": "There were 100 pints of wine in the cask, and on thirty occasions John\nthe Cellarer had stolen a pint and replaced it with a pint of water.\nAfter the first theft the wine left in the cask would be 99 pints; after\nthe second theft the wine in the cask would be 9801/100 pints (the square\nof 99 divided by 100); after the third theft there would remain\n970299/10000 (the cube of 99 divided by the square of 100); after the\nfourth theft there would remain the fourth power of 99 divided by the\ncube of 100; and after the thirtieth theft there would remain in the cask\nthe thirtieth power of 99 divided by the twenty-ninth power of 100. This\nby the ordinary method of calculation gives us a number composed of 59\nfigures to be divided by a number composed of 58 figures! But by the use\nof logarithms it may be quickly ascertained that the required quantity is\nvery nearly 73-97/100 pints of wine left in the cask. Consequently the\ncellarer stole nearly 26.03 pints. The monks doubtless omitted the answer\nfor the reason that they had no tables of logarithms, and did not care to\nface the task of making that long and tedious calculation in order to get\nthe quantity \"to a nicety,\" as the wily cellarer had stipulated.\n\nBy a simplified process of calculation, I have ascertained that the exact\nquantity of wine stolen would be\n\n  26.0299626611719577269984907683285057747323737647323555652999\n\npints.

A body of Crusaders went forth to fight the good cause, and such\nwas their number that they were able to form themselves into a square.\nBut on the way a stranger took up arms and joined them, and they were\nthen able to form exactly thirteen smaller squares. Pray tell me, merry\nmonks, how many men went forth to battle?\"\n\nAbbot David pushed aside his plate of warden pie, and made a few hasty\ncalculations.\n\"Sir Knight,\" said he at length, \"the riddle is easy to rede.

{"idx": 48, "title": "The Riddle of the Frogs' Ring", "content": "One Christmas the Abbot offered a prize of a large black jack mounted in\nsilver, to be engraved with the name of the monk who should put forth the\nbest new riddle. This tournament of wit was won by Brother Benedict, who,\ncuriously enough, never before or after gave out anything that did not\nexcite the ridicule of his brethren. It was called the \"Frogs' Ring.\"\n\nA ring was made with chalk on the floor of the hall, and divided into\nthirteen compartments, in which twelve discs of wood (called \"frogs\")\nwere placed in the order shown in our illustration, one place being left\nvacant. The numbers 1 to 6 were painted white and the numbers 7 to 12\nblack. The puzzle was to get all the white numbers where the black ones\nwere, and _vice versa_. The white frogs move round in one direction, and\nthe black ones the opposite way. They may move in any order one step at a\ntime, or jumping over one of the opposite colour to the place beyond,\njust as we play draughts to-day. The only other condition is that when\nall the frogs have changed sides, the 1 must be where the 12 now is and\nthe 12 in the place now occupied by 1. The puzzle was to perform the feat\nin as few moves as possible. How many moves are necessary?\n\nI will conclude in the words of the old writer: \"These be some of the\nriddles which the monks of Riddlewell did set forth and expound each to\nthe others in the merry days of the good Abbot David.\"\n\nTHE STRANGE ESCAPE OF THE KING'S JESTER.\n\n_A PUZZLING ADVENTURE._\n\nAt one time I was greatly in favour with the king, and his Majesty never\nseemed to weary of the companionship of the court fool. I had a gift for\nmaking riddles and quaint puzzles which ofttimes caused great sport; for\nalbeit the king never found the right answer of one of these things in\nall his life, yet would he make merry at the bewilderment of those about\nhim.\n\nBut let every cobbler stick unto his last; for when I did set out to\nlearn the art of performing strange tricks in the magic, wherein the hand\ndoth ever deceive the eye, the king was affrighted, and did accuse me of\nbeing a wizard, even commanding that I should be put to death. Luckily my\nwit did save my life. I begged that I might be slain by the royal hand\nand not by that of the executioner.\n\n\"By the saints,\" said his Majesty, \"what difference can it make unto\nthee? But since it is thy wish, thou shalt have thy choice whether I kill\nthee or the executioner.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I answered, \"I accept the choice that thou hast so\ngraciously offered to me: I prefer that your Majesty should kill the\nexecutioner.\"\n\nYet is the life of a royal jester beset with great dangers, and the king\nhaving once gotten it into his royal head that I was a wizard, it was not\nlong before I again fell into trouble, from which my wit did not a second\ntime in a like way save me. I was cast into the dungeon to await my\ndeath. How, by the help of my gift in answering riddles and puzzles, I\ndid escape from captivity I will now set forth; and in case it doth\nperplex any to know how some of the strange feats were performed, I will\nhereafter make the manner thereof plain to all.", "answer": "The fewest possible moves in which this puzzle can be solved are 118. I\nwill give the complete solution. The black figures on white discs move\nin the directions of the hands of a clock, and the white figures on black\ndiscs the other way. The following are the numbers in the order in which\nthey move. Whether you have to make a simple move or a leaping move will\nbe clear from the position, as you never can have an alternative. The\nmoves enclosed in brackets are to be played five times over: 6, 7, 8, 6,\n5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), 6,\n5, 4, 3, 2, 12, (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,\n12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 3, 2, 10, 11, 2. We\nthus have made 118 moves within the conditions, the black frogs have\nchanged places with the white ones, and 1 and 12 are side by side in the\npositions stipulated.\n\nThe general solution in the case of this puzzle is 3_n_^{2} + 2_n_ - 2\nmoves, where the number of frogs of each colour is _n_. The law governing\nthe sequence of moves is easily discovered by an examination of the\nsimpler cases, where _n_ = 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIf, instead of 11 and 12 changing places, the 6 and 7 must interchange,\nthe expression is _n_^{2} + 4_n_ + 2 moves. If we give _n_ the value 6,\nas in the example of the Frogs' Ring, the number of moves would be 62.\n\nFor a general solution of the case where frogs of one colour reverse\ntheir order, leaving the blank space in the same position, and each frog\nis allowed to be moved in either direction (leaping, of course, over his\nown colour), see \"The Grasshopper Puzzle\" in _A. in M._, p. 193.\n\nTHE STRANGE ESCAPE OF THE KING'S JESTER\n\nAlthough the king's jester promised that he would \"thereafter make the\nmanner thereof plain to all,\" there is no record of his having ever done\nso.

{"idx": 49, "title": "The Mysterious Rope", "content": "My dungeon did not lie beneath the moat, but was in one of the most high\nparts of the castle. So stout was the door, and so well locked and\nsecured withal, that escape that way was not to be found. By hard work I\ndid, after many days, remove one of the bars from the narrow window, and\nwas able to crush my body through the opening; but the distance to the\ncourtyard below was so exceeding great that it was certain death to drop\nthereto. Yet by great good fortune did I find in the corner of the cell a\nrope that had been there left and lay hid in the great darkness. But this\nrope had not length enough, and to drop in safety from the end was nowise\npossible. Then did I remember how the wise man from Ireland did lengthen\nthe blanket that was too short for him by cutting a yard off the bottom\nof the same and joining it on to the top. So I made haste to divide the\nrope in half and to tie the two parts thereof together again. It was then\nfull long, and did reach the ground, and I went down in safety. How could\nthis have been?", "answer": "When the jester \"divided his rope in half,\" it does not follow that he\ncut it into two parts, each half the original length of the rope. No\ndoubt he simply untwisted the strands, and so divided it into two ropes,\neach of the original length, but one-half the thickness. He would thus be\nable to tie the two together and make a rope nearly twice the original\nlength, with which it is quite conceivable that he made good his escape\nfrom the dungeon."}

But after I had got into it I did find\nthat the oars had been taken away, and that there was nothing that I\ncould use to row me across. When I had untied the rope and pushed off\nupon the water the boat lay quite still, there being no stream or current\nto help me. How, then, did I yet take the boat across the moat?", "answer": "No doubt some of my readers will smile at the statement that a man in a\nboat on smooth water can pull himself across with the tiller rope! But it\nis a fact. If the jester had fastened the end of his rope to the stern of\nthe boat and then, while standing in the bows, had given a series of\nviolent jerks, the boat would have been propelled forward. This has often\nbeen put to a practical test, and it is said that a speed of two or three\nmiles an hour may be attained. See W. W. Rouse Ball's _Mathematical\nRecreations_."}

The\nillustration perhaps shows Miss Charity's answer, and the figures on the\ncups indicate the number of lumps that have been separately placed in\nthem. By placing the cup that holds one lump inside the one that holds\ntwo lumps, it can be correctly stated that every cup contains an odd\nnumber of lumps. One cup holds seven lumps, another holds one lump, while\nthe third cup holds three lumps.

This is the report that Jabez made, though I\nhave taken it out of the old Somerset dialect, which might puzzle some\nreaders in a way not desired. \"Well, first of all I sold Mr. Jasper\nTyler half of the flock and half a goose over; then I sold Farmer Avent a\nthird of what remained and a third of a goose over; then I sold Widow\nFoster a quarter of what remained and three-quarters of a goose over; and\nas I was coming home, whom should I meet but Ned Collier: so we had a mug\nof cider together at the Barley Mow, where I sold him exactly a fifth of\nwhat I had left, and gave him a fifth of a goose over for the missus.\nThese nineteen that I have brought back I couldn't get rid of at any\nprice.\" Now, how many geese did Farmer Rouse send to market? My humane\nreaders may be relieved to know that no goose was divided or put to any\ninconvenience whatever by the sales.", "answer": "Farmer Rouse sent exactly 101 geese to market.

It will be seen\nthat the numbers of the left-hand group add up to 10, while the numbers\nin the other group add up to 29. The Major's puzzle was to rearrange the\neight boys in two new groups, so that the four numbers in each group\nshould add up alike.

I have no doubt (bearing in mind the Major's hint as to\nthe numbers being \"properly regarded\") that his answer was that depicted\nin the illustration, where boy No. 9 stands on his head and so converts\nhis number into 6. This makes the total 36--an even number--and by making\nboys 3 and 4 change places with 7 and 8, we get 1278 and 5346, the\nfigures of which, in each case, add up to 18.

But as no married man kissed a married woman other\nthan his own wife, we must deduct 42 kisses; as no male kissed another\nmale, we must deduct 171 kisses; and as no widow kissed another widow, we\nmust deduct 3 kisses.

Of a truth I did not venture to attempt it myself, after the\nyoung lawyer from Oxford, who they say is very learned in the mathematics\nand a great scholar, failed to show us the answer. He did assure us that\nhe believed it could not be done, but I have since been told that it is\npossible, though, of a certainty, I may not vouch for it. Master Herbert\nbrought with him two cubes of solid silver that belonged to his mother.\nHe showed that, as they measured two inches every way, each contained\neight cubic inches of silver, and therefore the two contained together\nsixteen cubic inches. That which he wanted to know was--'Could anybody\ngive him exact dimensions for two cubes that should together contain just\nseventeen cubic inches of silver?'\" Of course the cubes may be of\ndifferent sizes.\nThe idea of a Christmas Puzzle Party, as devised by the old Squire, seems\nto have been excellent, and it might well be revived at the present day\nby people who are fond of puzzles and who have grown tired of Book Teas\nand similar recent introductions for the amusement of evening parties.\nPrizes could be awarded to the best solvers of the puzzles propounded by\nthe guests.\n\nAdventures of the Puzzle Club\nWhen it recently became known that the bewildering mystery of the Prince\nand the Lost Balloon was really solved by the members of the Puzzle Club,\nthe general public was quite unaware that any such club existed. The fact\nis that the members always deprecated publicity; but since they have been\ndragged into the light in connection with this celebrated case, so many\nabsurd and untrue stories have become current respecting their doings\nthat I have been permitted to publish a correct account of some of their\nmore interesting achievements. It was, however, decided that the real\nnames of the members should not be given.\n\nThe club was started a few years ago to bring together those interested\nin the solution of puzzles of all kinds, and it contains some of the\nprofoundest mathematicians and some of the most subtle thinkers resident\nin London. These have done some excellent work of a high and dry kind.\nBut the main body soon took to investigating the problems of real life\nthat are perpetually cropping up.\n\nIt is only right to say that they take no interest in crimes as such, but\nonly investigate a case when it possesses features of a distinctly\npuzzling character. They seek perplexity for its own sake--something to\nunravel.

Baynes was a\nman of private means, with no occupation.\n\n\"Here's a quaint little poser for you all,\" said Baynes. \"I have received\nit to-day from Dovey.\"\n\nDovey was proprietor of one of the many private detective agencies that\nfound it to their advantage to keep in touch with the club.\n\n\"Is it another of those easy cryptograms?\" asked Wilson. \"If so, I would\nsuggest sending it upstairs to the billiard-marker.\"\n\n\"Don't be sarcastic, Wilson,\" said Melville. \"Remember, we are indebted\nto Dovey for the great Railway Signal Problem that gave us all a week's\namusement in the solving.\"\n\n\"If you fellows want to hear,\" resumed Baynes, \"just try to keep quiet\nwhile I relate the amusing affair to you. You all know of the jealous\nlittle Yankee who married Lord Marksford two years ago? Lady Marksford\nand her husband have been in Paris for two or three months. Well, the\npoor creature soon got under the influence of the green-eyed monster, and\nformed the opinion that Lord Marksford was flirting with other ladies of\nhis acquaintance.\n\n\"Now, she has actually put one of Dovey's spies on to that excellent\nhusband of hers; and the myrmidon has been shadowing him about for a\nfortnight with a pocket camera. A few days ago he came to Lady Marksford\nin great glee. He had snapshotted his lordship while actually walking in\nthe public streets with a lady who was not his wife.\"\n\n\"'What is the use of this at all?' asked the jealous woman.\n\n\"'Well, it is evidence, your ladyship, that your husband was walking with\nthe lady. I know where she is staying, and in a few days shall have found\nout all about her.'\n\n\"'But, you stupid man,' cried her ladyship, in tones of great contempt,\n'how can any one swear that this is his lordship, when the greater part\nof him, including his head and shoulders, is hidden from sight?\nAnd--and'--she scrutinized the photo carefully--'why, I guess it is\nimpossible from this photograph to say whether the gentleman is walking\nwith the lady or going in the opposite direction!'\n\n\"Thereupon she dismissed the detective in high dudgeon. Dovey has himself\njust returned from Paris, and got this account of the incident from her\nladyship. He wants to justify his man, if possible, by showing that the\nphoto does disclose which way the man is going. Here it is. See what you\nfellows can make of it.\"\n\nOur illustration is a faithful drawing made from the original photograph.\nIt will be seen that a slight but sudden summer shower is the real cause\nof the difficulty.\n\nAll agreed that Lady Marksford was right--that it is impossible to\ndetermine whether the man is walking with the lady or not.\n\n\"Her ladyship is wrong,\" said Baynes, after everybody had made a close\nscrutiny. \"I find there is important evidence in the picture. Look at it\ncarefully.\"\n\"Of course,\" said Melville, \"we can tell nothing from the frock-coat. It\nmay be the front or the tails. Blessed if I can say! Then he has his\novercoat over his arm, but which way his arm goes it is impossible to\nsee.\"\n\n\"How about the bend of the legs?\" asked Churton.\n\n\"Bend! why, there isn't any bend,\" put in Wilson, as he glanced over the\nother's shoulder. \"From the picture you might suspect that his lordship\nhas no knees. The fellow took his snapshot just when the legs happened to\nbe perfectly straight.\"\n\"I'm thinking that perhaps----\" began Macdonald, adjusting his\neye-glasses.\n\n\"Don't think, Mac,\" advised Wilson. \"It might hurt you. Besides, it is no\nuse you thinking that if the dog would kindly pass on things would be\neasy. He won't.\"\n\n\"The man's general pose seems to me to imply movement to the left,\"\nTomkins thought.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Melville declared, \"it appears to me clearly to\nsuggest movement to the right.\"\n\n\"Now, look here, you men,\" said Russell, whose opinions always carried\nrespect in the club. \"It strikes me that what we have to do is to\nconsider the attitude of the lady rather than that of the man. Does her\nattention seem to be directed to somebody by her side?\"\n\nEverybody agreed that it was impossible to say.\n\n\"I've got it!\" shouted Wilson. \"Extraordinary that none of you have seen\nit. It is as clear as possible. It all came to me in a flash!\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked Baynes.\n\n\"Why, it is perfectly obvious. You see which way the dog is going--to the\nleft. Very well. Now, Baynes, to whom does the dog belong?\"\n\n\"To the detective!\"\n\nThe laughter against Wilson that followed this announcement was simply\nboisterous, and so prolonged that Russell, who had at the time possession\nof the photo, seized the opportunity for making a most minute examination\nof it. In a few moments he held up his hands to invoke silence.\n\n\"Baynes is right,\" he said. \"There is important evidence there which\nsettles the matter with certainty. Assuming that the gentleman is really\nLord Marksford--and the figure, so far as it is visible, is his--I have\nno hesitation myself in saying that--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" all the members shouted at once.\n\n\"Don't break the rules of the club, Russell, though Wilson did,\" said\nMelville. \"Recollect that 'no member shall openly disclose his solution\nto a puzzle unless all present consent.'\"\n\n\"You need not have been alarmed,\" explained Russell. \"I was simply going\nto say that I have no hesitation in declaring that Lord Marksford is\nwalking in one particular direction. In which direction I will tell you\nwhen you have all 'given it up.'\"", "answer": "One by one the members of the Club succeeded in discovering the key to\nthe mystery of the Ambiguous Photograph, except Churton, who was at\nlength persuaded to \"give it up.\" Herbert Baynes then pointed out to him\nthat the coat that Lord Marksford was carrying over his arm was a lady's\ncoat, because the buttons are on the left side, whereas a man's coat\nalways has the buttons on the right-hand side. Lord Marksford would not\nbe likely to walk about the streets of Paris with a lady's coat over his\narm unless he was accompanying the owner. He was therefore walking with\nthe lady.\n\nAs they were talking a waiter brought a telegram to Baynes.\n\n\"Here you are,\" he said, after reading the message. \"A wire from Dovey:\n'Don't bother about photo. Find lady was the gentleman's sister, passing\nthrough Paris.' That settles it. You might notice that the lady was\nlightly clad, and therefore the coat might well be hers. But it is clear\nthat the rain was only a sudden shower, and no doubt they were close to\ntheir destination, and she did not think it worth while to put the coat\non.\""}
{"idx": 63, "title": "The Cornish Cliff Mystery", "content": "Though the incident known in the Club as \"The Cornish Cliff Mystery\" has\nnever been published, every one remembers the case with which it was\nconnected--an embezzlement at Todd's Bank in Cornhill a few years ago.\nLamson and Marsh, two of the firm's clerks, suddenly disappeared; and it\nwas found that they had absconded with a very large sum of money. There\nwas an exciting hunt for them by the police, who were so prompt in their\naction that it was impossible for the thieves to get out of the country.\nThey were traced as far as Truro, and were known to be in hiding in\nCornwall.\n\nJust at this time it happened that Henry Melville and Fred Wilson were\naway together on a walking tour round the Cornish coast. Like most\npeople, they were interested in the case; and one morning, while at\nbreakfast at a little inn, they learnt that the absconding men had been\ntracked to that very neighbourhood, and that a strong cordon of police\nhad been drawn round the district, making an escape very improbable. In\nfact, an inspector and a constable came into the inn to make some\ninquiries, and exchanged civilities with the two members of the Puzzle\nClub. A few references to some of the leading London detectives, and the\nproduction of a confidential letter Melville happened to have in his\npocket from one of them, soon established complete confidence, and the\ninspector opened out.\n\nHe said that he had just been to examine a very important clue a quarter\nof a mile from there, and expressed the opinion that Messrs. Lamson and\nMarsh would never again be found alive. At the suggestion of Melville the\nfour men walked along the road together.\n\n\"There is our stile in the distance,\" said the inspector. \"This constable\nfound beside it the pocket-book that I have shown you, containing the\nname of Marsh and some memoranda in his handwriting. It had evidently\nbeen dropped by accident. On looking over the stone stile he noticed the\nfootprints of two men--which I have already proved from particulars\npreviously supplied to the police to be those of the men we want--and I\nam sure you will agree that they point to only one possible conclusion.\"\n\nArrived at the spot, they left the hard road and got over the stile. The\nfootprints of the two men were here very clearly impressed in the thin\nbut soft soil, and they all took care not to trample on the tracks. They\nfollowed the prints closely, and found that they led straight to the edge\nof a cliff forming a sheer precipice, almost perpendicular, at the foot\nof which the sea, some two hundred feet below, was breaking among the\nboulders.\n\"Here, gentlemen, you see,\" said the inspector, \"that the footprints lead\nstraight to the edge of the cliff, where there is a good deal of\ntrampling about, and there end. The soil has nowhere been disturbed for\nyards around, except by the footprints that you see. The conclusion is\nobvious.\"\n\n\"That, knowing they were unable to escape capture, they decided not to be\ntaken alive, and threw themselves over the cliff?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Exactly. Look to the right and the left, and you will find no footprints\nor other marks anywhere. Go round there to the left, and you will be\nsatisfied that the most experienced mountaineer that ever lived could\nnot make a descent, or even anywhere get over the edge of the cliff.\nThere is no ledge or foothold within fifty feet.\"\n\n\"Utterly impossible,\" said Melville, after an inspection. \"What do you\npropose to do?\"\n\n\"I am going straight back to communicate the discovery to headquarters.\nWe shall withdraw the cordon and search the coast for the dead bodies.\"\n\n\"Then you will make a fatal mistake,\" said Melville. \"The men are alive\nand in hiding in the district. Just examine the prints again. Whose is\nthe large foot?\"\n\n\"That is Lamson's, and the small print is Marsh's. Lamson was a tall man,\njust over six feet, and Marsh was a little fellow.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Melville. \"And yet you will find that Lamson\ntakes a shorter stride than Marsh. Notice, also, the peculiarity that\nMarsh walks heavily on his heels, while Lamson treads more on his toes.\nNothing remarkable in that? Perhaps not; but has it occurred to you that\nLamson walked behind Marsh? Because you will find that he sometimes\ntreads over Marsh's footsteps, though you will never find Marsh treading\nin the steps of the other.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that the men walked backwards in their own footprints?\"\nasked the inspector.\n\n\"No; that is impossible. No two men could walk backwards some two hundred\nyards in that way with such exactitude. You will not find a single place\nwhere they have missed the print by even an eighth of an inch. Quite\nimpossible. Nor do I suppose that two men, hunted as they were, could\nhave provided themselves with flying-machines, balloons, or even\nparachutes. They did not drop over the cliff.\"\n\nMelville then explained how the men had got away. His account proved to\nbe quite correct, for it will be remembered that they were caught, hiding\nunder some straw in a barn, within two miles of the spot. How did they\nget away from the edge of the cliff?", "answer": "Melville's explanation of the Cornish Cliff Mystery was very simple when\nhe gave it. Yet it was an ingenious trick that the two criminals adopted,\nand it would have completely succeeded had not our friends from the\nPuzzle Club accidentally appeared on the scene. This is what happened:\nWhen Lamson and Marsh reached the stile, Marsh alone walked to the top of\nthe cliff, with Lamson's larger boots in his hands. Arrived at the edge\nof the cliff, he changed the boots and walked backwards to the stile,\ncarrying his own boots.\n\nThis little manoeuvre accounts for the smaller footprints showing a\ndeeper impression at the heel, and the larger prints a deeper impression\nat the toe; for a man will walk more heavily on his heels when going\nforward, but will make a deeper impression with the toes in walking\nbackwards. It will also account for the fact that the large footprints\nwere sometimes impressed over the smaller ones, but never the reverse;\nalso for the circumstance that the larger footprints showed a shorter\nstride, for a man will necessarily take a smaller stride when walking\nbackwards. The pocket-book was intentionally dropped, to lead the police\nto discover the footprints, and so be put on the wrong scent."}
{"idx": 64, "title": "The Runaway Motor-Car", "content": "The little affair of the \"Runaway Motor-car\" is a good illustration of\nhow a knowledge of some branch of puzzledom may be put to unexpected use.\nA member of the Club, whose name I have at the moment of writing\nforgotten, came in one night and said that a friend of his was bicycling\nin Surrey on the previous day, when a motor-car came from behind, round a\ncorner, at a terrific speed, caught one of his wheels, and sent him\nflying in the road. He was badly knocked about, and fractured his left\narm, while his machine was wrecked. The motor-car was not stopped, and he\nhad been unable to trace it.\n\nThere were two witnesses to the accident, which was beyond question the\nfault of the driver of the car. An old woman, a Mrs. Wadey, saw the whole\nthing, and tried to take the number of the car. She was positive as to\nthe letters, which need not be given, and was certain also that the first\nfigure was a 1. The other figures she failed to read on account of the\nspeed and dust.\n\nThe other witness was the village simpleton, who just escapes being an\narithmetical genius, but is excessively stupid in everything else.\n\nHe is always working out sums in his head; and all he could say was that\nthere were five figures in the number, and that he found that when he\nmultiplied the first two figures by the last three they made the same\nfigures, only in different order--just as 24 multiplied by 651 makes\n15,624 (the same five figures), in which case the number of the car would\nhave been 24,651; and he knew there was no 0 in the number.\n\n\"It will be easy enough to find that car,\" said Russell. \"The known facts\nare possibly sufficient to enable one to discover the exact number. You\nsee, there must be a limit to the five-figure numbers having the\npeculiarity observed by the simpleton. And these are further limited by\nthe fact that, as Mrs. Wadey states, the number began with the figure 1.\nWe have therefore to find these numbers. It may conceivably happen that\nthere is only one such number, in which case the thing is solved. But\neven if there are several cases, the owner of the actual car may easily\nbe found.\n\n\"How will you manage that?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"Surely,\" replied Russell, \"the method is quite obvious. By the process\nof elimination. Every owner except the one in fault will be able to prove\nan alibi. Yet, merely guessing offhand, I think it quite probable that\nthere is only one number that fits the case. We shall see.\"\nRussell was right, for that very night he sent the number by post, with\nthe result that the runaway car was at once traced, and its owner, who\nwas himself driving, had to pay the cost of the damages resulting from\nhis carelessness. What was the number of the car?", "answer": "Russell found that there are just twelve five-figure numbers that have\nthe peculiarity that the first two figures multiplied by the last\nthree--all the figures being different, and there being no 0--will\nproduce a number with exactly the same five figures, in a different\norder. But only one of these twelve begins with a 1--namely, 14926. Now,\nif we multiply 14 by 926, the result is 12964, which contains the same\nfive figures. The number of the motor-car was therefore 14926.\n\nHere are the other eleven numbers:--24651, 42678, 51246, 57834, 75231,\n78624, 87435, 72936, 65281, 65983, and 86251."}
{"idx": 66, "title": "The Buried Treasure", "content": "The problem of the Buried Treasure was of quite a different character. A\nyoung fellow named Dawkins, just home from Australia, was introduced to\nthe club by one of the members, in order that he might relate an\nextraordinary stroke of luck that he had experienced \"down under,\" as the\ncircumstances involved the solution of a poser that could not fail to\ninterest all lovers of puzzle problems. After the club dinner, Dawkins\nwas asked to tell his story, which he did, to the following effect:--\n\n\"I have told you, gentlemen, that I was very much down on my luck. I had\ngone out to Australia to try to retrieve my fortunes, but had met with no\nsuccess, and the future was looking very dark. I was, in fact, beginning\nto feel desperate. One hot summer day I happened to be seated in a\nMelbourne wineshop, when two fellows entered, and engaged in\nconversation. They thought I was asleep, but I assure you I was very wide\nawake.\n\n\"'If only I could find the right field,' said one man, 'the treasure\nwould be mine; and as the original owner left no heir, I have as much\nright to it as anybody else.'\n\n\"'How would you proceed?' asked the other.\n\n\"'Well, it is like this: The document that fell into my hands states\nclearly that the field is square, and that the treasure is buried in it\nat a point exactly two furlongs from one corner, three furlongs from the\nnext corner, and four furlongs from the next corner to that. You see, the\nworst of it is that nearly all the fields in the district are square;\nand I doubt whether there are two of exactly the same size. If only I\nknew the size of the field I could soon discover it, and, by taking these\nsimple measurements, quickly secure the treasure.'\n\n\"'But you would not know which corner to start from, nor which direction\nto go to the next corner.'\n\n\"'My dear chap, that only means eight spots at the most to dig over; and\nas the paper says that the treasure is three feet deep, you bet that\nwouldn't take me long.'\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" continued Dawkins, \"I happen to be a bit of a\nmathematician; and hearing the conversation, I saw at once that for a\nspot to be exactly two, three, and four furlongs from successive corners\nof a square, the square must be of a particular area. You can't get such\nmeasurements to meet at one point in any square you choose. They can only\nhappen in a field of one size, and that is just what these men never\nsuspected. I will leave you the puzzle of working out just what that area\nis.\n\n\"Well, when I found the size of the field, I was not long in discovering\nthe field itself, for the man had let out the district in the\nconversation. And I did not need to make the eight digs, for, as luck\nwould have it, the third spot I tried was the right one. The treasure was\na substantial sum, for it has brought me home and enabled me to start in\na business that already shows signs of being a particularly lucrative\none. I often smile when I think of that poor fellow going about for the\nrest of his life saying: 'If only I knew the size of the field!' while he\nhas placed the treasure safe in my own possession. I tried to find the\nman, to make him some compensation anonymously, but without success.\nPerhaps he stood in little need of the money, while it has saved me from\nruin.\"\n\nCould the reader have discovered the required area of the field from\nthose details overheard in the wineshop? It is an elegant little puzzle,\nand furnishes another example of the practical utility, on unexpected\noccasions, of a knowledge of the art of problem-solving.\n\nTHE PROFESSOR'S PUZZLES\n\n\"Why, here is the Professor!\" exclaimed Grigsby. \"We'll make him show us\nsome new puzzles.\"\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the club was nearly deserted. Only Grigsby,\nHawkhurst, and myself, of all the members, seemed to be detained in town\nover the season of mirth and mince-pies. The man, however, who had just\nentered was a welcome addition to our number. \"The Professor of Puzzles,\"\nas we had nicknamed him, was very popular at the club, and when, as on\nthe present occasion, things got a little slow, his arrival was a\npositive blessing.\n\nHe was a man of middle age, cheery and kind-hearted, but inclined to be\ncynical. He had all his life dabbled in puzzles, problems, and enigmas of\nevery kind, and what the Professor didn't know about these matters was\nadmittedly not worth knowing. His puzzles always had a charm of their\nown, and this was mainly because he was so happy in dishing them up in\npalatable form.\n\n\"You are the man of all others that we were hoping would drop in,\" said\nHawkhurst. \"Have you got anything new?\"\n\n\"I have always something new,\" was the reply, uttered with feigned\nconceit--for the Professor was really a modest man--\"I'm simply glutted\nwith ideas.\"\n\n\"Where do you get all your notions?\" I asked.\n\n\"Everywhere, anywhere, during all my waking moments. Indeed, two or three\nof my best puzzles have come to me in my dreams.\"\n\n\"Then all the good ideas are not used up?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. And all the old puzzles are capable of improvement,\nembellishment, and extension. Take, for example, magic squares. These\nwere constructed in India before the Christian era, and introduced into\nEurope about the fourteenth century, when they were supposed to possess\ncertain magical properties that I am afraid they have since lost. Any\nchild can arrange the numbers one to nine in a square that will add up\nfifteen in eight ways; but you will see it can be developed into quite a\nnew problem if you use coins instead of numbers.\"", "answer": "The field must have contained between 179 and 180 acres--to be more\nexact, 179.37254 acres. Had the measurements been 3, 2, and 4 furlongs\nrespectively from successive corners, then the field would have been\n209.70537 acres in area.\n\nOne method of solving this problem is as follows. Find the area of\ntriangle APB in terms of _x_, the side of the square. Double the\nresult=_xy_. Divide by _x_ and then square, and we have the value of\n_y_^{2} in terms of _x_. Similarly find value of _z_^{2} in terms of _x_;\nthen solve the equation _y_^{2}+_z_^{2}=3^{2}, which will come out in the\nform _x_^{4}-20_x_^{2}=-37. Therefore _x_^{2}=10+(sqrt{63})=17.937254\nsquare furlongs, very nearly, and as there are ten acres in one square\nfurlong, this equals 179.37254 acres. If we take the negative root of the\nequation, we get the area of the field as 20.62746 acres, in which case\nthe treasure would have been buried outside the field, as in Diagram 2.\nBut this solution is excluded by the condition that the treasure was\nburied in the field. The words were, \"The document ... states clearly\nthat the field is square, and that the treasure is buried in it.\"\nTHE PROFESSOR'S PUZZLES"}
{"idx": 73, "title": "The Game of Kayles", "content": "Nearly all of our most popular games are of very ancient origin, though\nin many cases they have been considerably developed and improved.\nKayles--derived from the French word _quilles_--was a great favourite in\nthe fourteenth century, and was undoubtedly the parent of our modern game\nof ninepins. Kayle-pins were not confined in those days to any particular\nnumber, and they were generally made of a conical shape and set up in a\nstraight row.\n\nAt first they were knocked down by a club that was thrown at them from a\ndistance, which at once suggests the origin of the pastime of \"shying for\ncocoanuts\" that is to-day so popular on Bank Holidays on Hampstead Heath\nand elsewhere. Then the players introduced balls, as an improvement on\nthe club.\n\nIn the illustration we get a picture of some of our fourteenth-century\nancestors playing at kayle-pins in this manner.\n\nNow, I will introduce to my readers a new game of parlour kayle-pins,\nthat can be played across the table without any preparation whatever. You\nsimply place in a straight row thirteen dominoes, chess-pawns,\ndraughtsmen, counters, coins, or beans--anything will do--all close\ntogether, and then remove the second one as shown in the picture.\n\nIt is assumed that the ancient players had become so expert that they\ncould always knock down any single kayle-pin, or any two kayle-pins that\nstood close together. They therefore altered the game, and it was agreed\nthat the player who knocked down the last pin was the winner.\n\nTherefore, in playing our table-game, all you have to do is to knock down\nwith your fingers, or take away, any single kayle-pin or two adjoining\nkayle-pins, playing alternately until one of the two players makes the\nlast capture, and so wins. I think it will be found a fascinating little\ngame, and I will show the secret of winning.\nRemember that the second kayle-pin must be removed before you begin to\nplay, and that if you knock down two at once those two must be close\ntogether, because in the real game the ball could not do more than this.", "answer": "To win at this game you must, sooner or later, leave your opponent an\neven number of similar groups. Then whatever he does in one group you\nrepeat in a similar group. Suppose, for example, that you leave him these\ngroups: o.o.ooo.ooo. Now, if he knocks down a single, you knock down a\nsingle; if he knocks down two in one triplet, you knock down two in the\nother triplet; if he knocks down the central kayle in a triplet, you\nknock down the central one in the other triplet. In this way you must\neventually win. As the game is started with the arrangement\no.ooooooooooo, the first player can always win, but only by knocking down\nthe sixth or tenth kayle (counting the one already fallen as the second),\nand this leaves in either case o.ooo.ooooooo, as the order of the groups\nis of no importance. Whatever the second player now does, this can always\nbe resolved into an even number of equal groups. Let us suppose that he\nknocks down the single one; then we play to leave him oo.ooooooo. Now,\nwhatever he does we can afterwards leave him either ooo.ooo or o.oo.ooo.\nWe know why the former wins, and the latter wins also; because, however\nhe may play, we can always leave him either o.o, or o.o.o.o, or oo.oo, as\nthe case may be. The complete analysis I can now leave for the amusement\nof the reader."}
{"idx": 76, "title": "The Perplexed Cellarman", "content": "Here is a little puzzle culled from the traditions of an old monastery in\nthe west of England. Abbot Francis, it seems, was a very worthy man; and\nhis methods of equity extended to those little acts of charity for which\nhe was noted for miles round.\nThe Abbot, moreover, had a fine taste in wines. On one occasion he sent\nfor the cellarman, and complained that a particular bottling was not to\nhis palate.\n\n\"Pray tell me, Brother John, how much of this wine thou didst bottle\nwithal.\"\n\n\"A fair dozen in large bottles, my lord abbot, and the like in the\nsmall,\" replied the cellarman, \"whereof five of each have been drunk in\nthe refectory.\"\n\n\"So be it. There be three varlets waiting at the gate. Let the two dozen\nbottles be given unto them, both full and empty; and see that the dole be\nfairly made, so that no man receive more wine than another, nor any\ndifference in bottles.\"\n\nPoor John returned to his cellar, taking the three men with him, and then\nhis task began to perplex him. Of full bottles he had seven large and\nseven small, and of empty bottles five large and five small, as shown in\nthe illustration. How was he to make the required equitable division?\n\nHe divided the bottles into three groups in several ways that at first\nsight seemed to be quite fair, since two small bottles held just the same\nquantity of wine as one large one. But the large bottles themselves, when\nempty, were not worth two small ones.\n\nHence the abbot's order that each man must take away the same number of\nbottles of each size.\n\nFinally, the cellarman had to consult one of the monks who was good at\npuzzles of this kind, and who showed him how the thing was done. Can you\nfind out just how the distribution was made?", "answer": "Brother John gave the first man three large bottles and one small\nbottleful of wine, and one large and three small empty bottles. To each\nof the other two men he gave two large and three small bottles of wine,\nand two large and one small empty bottle. Each of the three then receives\nthe same quantity of wine, and the same number of each size of bottle."}
{"idx": 82, "title": "The Wizard's Arithmetic", "content": "Once upon a time a knight went to consult a certain famous wizard.

He then took in his hands an 8 and a 3, and\nheld them together to form the number 83.\n\n\"Sir Knight, tell me,\" said the wizard, \"canst thou multiply one number\ninto the other in thy mind?\"\n\n\"Nay, of a truth,\" the good knight replied. \"I should need to set out\nupon the task with pen and scrip.\"\n\n\"Yet mark ye how right easy a thing it is to a man learned in the lore of\nfar Araby, who knoweth all the magic that is hid in the philosophy of\nnumbers!\"\n\nThe wizard simply placed the 3 next to the 4 on the shelf, and the 8 at\nthe other end. It will be found that this gives the answer quite\ncorrectly--3410968. Very curious, is it not? How many other two-figure\nmultipliers can you find that will produce the same effect? You may place\njust as many blocks as you like on the shelf, bearing any figures you\nchoose.", "answer": "This puzzle is both easy and difficult, for it is a very simple matter to\nfind one of the multipliers, which is 86. If we multiply 8 by 86, all we\nneed do is to place the 6 in front and the 8 behind in order to get the\ncorrect answer, 688. But the second number is not to be found by mere\ntrial. It is 71, and the number to be multiplied is no less than\n1639344262295081967213114754098360655737704918032787. If you want to\nmultiply this by 71, all you have to do is to place another 1 at the\nbeginning and another 7 at the end--a considerable saving of labour!\nThese two, and the example shown by the wizard, are the only two-figure\nmultipliers, but the number to be multiplied may always be increased.\nThus, if you prefix to 41096 the number 41095890, repeated any number of\ntimes, the result may always be multiplied by 83 in the wizard's peculiar\nmanner.\n\nIf we add the figures of any number together and then, if necessary,\nagain add, we at last get a single-figure number. This I call the\n\"digital root.\" Thus, the digital root of 521 is 8, and of 697 it is 4.\nThis digital analysis is extensively dealt with in _A. in M._ Now, it is\nevident that the digital roots of the two numbers required by the puzzle\nmust produce the same root in sum and product. This can only happen when\nthe roots of the two numbers are 2 and 2, or 9 and 9, or 3 and 6, or 5\nand 8. Therefore the two-figure multiplier must have a digital root of 2,\n3, 5, 6, 8, or 9. There are ten such numbers in each case. I write out\nall the sixty, then I strike out all those numbers where the second\nfigure is higher than the first, and where the two figures are alike\n(thirty-six numbers in all); also all remaining numbers where the first\nfigure is odd and the second figure even (seven numbers); also all\nmultiples of 5 (three more numbers). The numbers 21 and 62 I reject on\ninspection, for reasons that I will not enter into. I then have left, out\nof the original sixty, only the following twelve numbers: 83, 63, 81, 84,\n93, 42, 51, 87, 41, 86, 53, and 71. These are the only possible\nmultipliers that I have really to examine.\n\nMy process is now as curious as it is simple in working. First trying 83,\nI deduct 10 and call it 73. Adding 0's to the second figure, I say if\n30000, etc., ever has a remainder 43 when divided by 73, the dividend\nwill be the required multiplier for 83. I get the 43 in this way. The\nonly multiplier of 3 that produces an 8 in the digits place is 6. I\ntherefore multiply 73 by 6 and get 438, or 43 after rejecting the 8. Now,\n300,000 divided by 73 leaves the remainder 43, and the dividend is 4,109.\nTo this 1 add the 6 mentioned above and get 41,096 x 83, the example\ngiven on page 129.\n\nIn trying the even numbers there are two cases to be considered. Thus,\ntaking 86, we may say that if 60000, etc., when divided by 76 leaves\neither 22 or 60 (because 3×6 and 8×6 both produce 8), we get a solution.\nBut I reject the former on inspection, and see that 60 divided by 76 is\n0, leaving a remainder 60. Therefore 8 x 86 = 688, the other example. It\nwill be found in the case of 71 that 100000, etc., divided by 61 gives a\nremainder 42, (7 × 61 = 427) after producing the long dividend at the\nbeginning of this article, with the 7 added.\n\nThe other multipliers fail to produce a solution, so 83, 86, and 71 are\nthe only three possible multipliers. Those who are familiar with the\nprinciple of recurring decimals (as somewhat explained in my next note on\nNo. 83, \"The Ribbon Problem\") will understand the conditions under which\nthe remainders repeat themselves after certain periods, and will only\nfind it necessary in two or three cases to make any lengthy divisions. It\nclearly follows that there is an unlimited number of multiplicands for\neach multiplier."}
{"idx": 83, "title": "The Ribbon Problem", "content": "If we take the ribbon by the ends and pull it out straight, we have the\nnumber 0588235294117647. This number has the peculiarity that, if we\nmultiply it by any one of the numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, we get\nexactly the same number in the circle, starting from a different place.\nFor example, multiply by 4, and the product is 2352941176470588, which\nstarts from the dart in the circle. So, if we multiply by 3, we get the\nsame result starting from the star. Now, the puzzle is to place a\ndifferent arrangement of figures on the ribbon that will produce similar\nresults when so multiplied; only the 0 and the 7 appearing at the ends of\nthe ribbon must not be removed.", "answer": "The solution is as follows: Place this rather lengthy number on the\nribbon, 0212765957446808510638297872340425531914393617. It may be\nmultiplied by any number up to 46 inclusive to give the same order of\nfigures in the ring. The number previously given can be multiplied by any\nnumber up to 16. I made the limit 9 in order to put readers off the\nscent. The fact is these two numbers are simply the recurring decimals\nthat equal 1/17 and 1/47 respectively. Multiply the one by seventeen and\nthe other by forty-seven, and you will get all nines in each case.\n\nIn transforming a vulgar fraction, say 1/17, to a decimal fraction, we\nproceed as below, adding as many noughts to the dividend as we like until\nthere is no remainder, or until we get a recurring series of figures, or\nuntil we have carried it as far as we require, since every additional\nfigure in a never-ending decimal carries us nearer and nearer to\nexactitude.\n\n  17) 100 (.058823\n       85\n     ----\n       150\n       136\n      ----\n        140\n        136\n       ----\n          40\n          34\n        ----\n           60\n           51\n         ----\n            9\n\nNow, since all powers of 10 can only contain factors of the powers of 2\nand 5, it clearly follows that your decimal never will come to an end if\nany other factor than these occurs in the denominator of your vulgar\nfraction. Thus, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 give us the exact decimals, .5, .25,\nand .125; 1/5 and 1/25 give us .2 and .04; 1/10 and 1/20 give us .1 and\n.05: because the denominators are all composed of 2 and 5 factors. But if\nyou wish to convert 1/3, 1/6, or 1/7, your division sum will never end,\nbut you will get these decimals, .33333, etc., .166666, etc., and\n.142857142857142857, etc., where, in the first case, the 3 keeps on\nrepeating for ever and ever; in the second case the 6 is the repeater,\nand in the last case we get the recurring period of 142857. In the case\nof 1/17 (in \"The Ribbon Problem\") we find the circulating period to be\n.0588235294117647.\n\nNow, in the division sum above, the successive remainders are 1, 10, 15,\n14, 4, 6, 9, etc., and these numbers I have inserted around the inner\nring of the diagram. It will be seen that every number from 1 to 16\noccurs once, and that if we multiply our ribbon number by any one of the\nnumbers in the inner ring its position indicates exactly the point at\nwhich the product will begin. Thus, if we multiply by 4, the product will\nbe 235, etc.; if we multiply by 6, 352, etc. We can therefore multiply by\nany number from 1 to 16 and get the desired result.\nThe kernel of the puzzle is this: Any prime number, with the exception of\n2 and 5, which are the factors of 10, will exactly divide without\nremainder a number consisting of as many nines as the number itself, less\none. Thus 999999 (six 9's) is divisible by 7, sixteen 9's are divisible\nby 17, eighteen 9's by 19, and so on. This is always the case, though\nfrequently fewer 9's will suffice; for one 9 is divisible by 3, two by\n11, six by 13, when our ribbon rule for consecutive multipliers breaks\ndown and another law comes in. Therefore, since the 0 and 7 at the ends\nof the ribbon may not be removed, we must seek a fraction with a prime\ndenominator ending in 7 that gives a full period circulator. We try 37,\nand find that it gives a short period decimal, .027, because 37 exactly\ndivides 999; it, therefore, will not do. We next examine 47, and find\nthat it gives us the full period circulator, in 46 figures, at the\nbeginning of this article.\n\nIf you cut any of these full period circulators in half and place one\nhalf under the other, you will find that they will add up all 9's; so you\nneed only work out one half and then write down the complements. Thus, in\nthe ribbon above, if you add 05882352 to 94117647 the result is 99999999,\nand so with our long solution number. Note also in the diagram above that\nnot only are the opposite numbers on the outer ring complementary, always\nmaking 9 when added, but that opposite numbers in the inner ring, our\nremainders, are also complementary, adding to 17 in every case. I ought\nperhaps to point out that in limiting our multipliers to the first nine\nnumbers it seems just possible that a short period circulator might give\na solution in fewer figures, but there are reasons for thinking it\nimprobable."}
{"idx": 84, "title": "The Japanese Ladies and the Carpet", "content": "Three Japanese ladies possessed a square ancestral carpet of considerable\nintrinsic value, but treasured also as an interesting heirloom in the\nfamily. They decided to cut it up and make three square rugs of it, so\nthat each should possess a share in her own house.\n\nOne lady suggested that the simplest way would be for her to take a\nsmaller share than the other two, because then the carpet need not be cut\ninto more than four pieces.\n\nThere are three easy ways of doing this, which I will leave the reader\nfor the present the amusement of finding for himself, merely saying that\nif you suppose the carpet to be nine square feet, then one lady may take\na piece two feet square whole, another a two feet square in two pieces,\nand the third a square foot whole.\n\nBut this generous offer would not for a moment be entertained by the\nother two sisters, who insisted that the square carpet should be so cut\nthat each should get a square mat of exactly the same size.\n\nNow, according to the best Western authorities, they would have found it\nnecessary to cut the carpet into seven pieces; but a correspondent in\nTokio assures me that the legend is that they did it in as few as six\npieces, and he wants to know whether such a thing is possible.\n\nYes; it can be done.\n\nCan you cut out the six pieces that will form three square mats of equal\nsize?", "answer": "If the squares had not to be all the same size, the carpet could be cut\nin four pieces in any one of the three manners shown. In each case the\ntwo pieces marked A will fit together and form one of the three squares,\nthe other two squares being entire. But in order to have the squares\nexactly equal in size, we shall require six pieces, as shown in the\nlarger diagram. No. 1 is a complete square, pieces 4 and 5 will form a\nsecond square, and pieces 2, 3, and 6 will form the third--all of exactly\nthe same size.\n\nIf with the three equal squares we form the rectangle IDBA, then the mean\nproportional of the two sides of the rectangle will be the side of a\nsquare of equal area. Produce AB to C, making BC equal to BD. Then place\nthe point of the compasses at E (midway between A and C) and describe the\narc AC. I am showing the quite general method for converting rectangles\nto squares, but in this particular case we may, of course, at once place\nour compasses at E, which requires no finding. Produce the line BD,\ncutting the arc in F, and BF will be the required side of the square. Now\nmark off AG and DH, each equal to BF, and make the cut IG, and also the\ncut HK from H, perpendicular to ID. The six pieces produced are numbered\nas in the diagram on last page.\n\nIt will be seen that I have here given the reverse method first: to cut\nthe three small squares into six pieces to form a large square. In the\ncase of our puzzle we can proceed as follows:--\n\nMake LM equal to half the diagonal ON. Draw the line NM and drop from L a\nperpendicular on NM. Then LP will be the side of all the three squares of\ncombined area equal to the large square QNLO. The reader can now cut out\nwithout difficulty the six pieces, as shown in the numbered square on the\nlast page."}
{"idx": 85, "title": "Captain Longbow and the Bears", "content": "That eminent and more or less veracious traveller Captain Longbow has a\ngreat grievance with the public. He claims that during a recent\nexpedition in Arctic regions he actually reached the North Pole, but\ncannot induce anybody to believe him. Of course, the difficulty in such\ncases is to produce proof, but he avers that future travellers, when they\nsucceed in accomplishing the same feat, will find evidence on the spot.\nHe says that when he got there he saw a bear going round and round the\ntop of the pole (which he declares _is_ a pole), evidently perplexed by\nthe peculiar fact that no matter in what direction he looked it was\nalways due south. Captain Longbow put an end to the bear's meditations by\nshooting him, and afterwards impaling him, in the manner shown in the\nillustration, as the evidence for future travellers to which I have\nalluded.\nWhen the Captain got one hundred miles south on his return journey he had\na little experience that is somewhat puzzling. He was surprised one\nmorning, on looking down from an elevation, to see no fewer than eleven\nbears in his immediate vicinity. But what astonished him more than\nanything else was the curious fact that they had so placed themselves\nthat there were seven rows of bears, with four bears in every row.\nWhether or not this was the result of pure accident he cannot say, but\nsuch a thing might have happened. If the reader tries to make eleven dots\non a sheet of paper so that there shall be seven rows of dots with four\ndots in every row, he will find some difficulty; but the captain's\nalleged grouping of the bears is quite possible. Can you discover how\nthey were arranged?", "answer": "It might have struck the reader that the story of the bear impaled on the\nNorth Pole had no connection with the problem that followed. As a matter\nof fact it is essential to a solution. Eleven bears cannot possibly be\narranged to form of themselves seven rows of bears with four bears in\nevery row. But it is a different matter when Captain Longbow informs us\nthat \"they had so placed themselves that _there were_\" seven rows of four\nbears. For if they were grouped as shown in the diagram, so that three of\nthe bears, as indicated, were in line with the North Pole, that impaled\nanimal would complete the seventh row of four, which cannot be obtained\nin any other way. It obviously does not affect the problem whether this\nseventh row is a hundred miles long or a hundred feet, so long as they\nwere really in a straight line--a point that might perhaps be settled by\nthe captain's pocket compass."}

{"idx": 97, "title": "The Perplexed Plumber", "content": "When I paid a visit to Peckham recently I found everybody asking, \"What\nhas happened to Sam Solders, the plumber?\" He seemed to be in a bad way,\nand his wife was seriously anxious about the state of his mind. As he had\nfitted up a hot-water apparatus for me some years ago which did not lead\nto an explosion for at least three months (and then only damaged the\ncomplexion of one of the cook's followers), I had considerable regard for\nhim.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Mrs. Solders, when I called to inquire. \"That's how\nhe's been for three weeks. He hardly eats anything, and takes no rest,\nwhilst his business is so neglected that I don't know what is going to\nhappen to me and the five children. All day long--and night too--there he\nis, figuring and figuring, and tearing his hair like a mad thing. It's\nworrying me into an early grave.\"\n\nI persuaded Mrs. Solders to explain matters to me. It seems that he had\nreceived an order from a customer to make two rectangular zinc cisterns,\none with a top and the other without a top. Each was to hold exactly\n1,000 cubic feet of water when filled to the brim. The price was to be a\ncertain amount per cistern, including cost of labour. Now Mr. Solders is\na thrifty man, so he naturally desired to make the two cisterns of such\ndimensions that the smallest possible quantity of metal should be\nrequired. This was the little question that was so worrying him.\nCan my ingenious readers find the dimensions of the most economical\ncistern with a top, and also the exact proportions of such a cistern\nwithout a top, each to hold 1,000 cubic feet of water? By \"economical\" is\nmeant the method that requires the smallest possible quantity of metal.\nNo margin need be allowed for what ladies would call \"turnings.\" I shall\nshow how I helped Mr. Solders out of his dilemma. He says: \"That little\nwrinkle you gave me would be useful to others in my trade.\"", "answer": "The rectangular closed cistern that shall hold a given quantity of water\nand yet have the smallest possible surface of metal must be a perfect\ncube--that is, a cistern every side of which is a square. For 1,000 cubic\nfeet of water the internal dimensions will be 10 ft. × 10 ft. × 10 ft.,\nand the zinc required will be 600 square feet. In the case of a cistern\nwithout a top the proportions will be exactly half a cube. These are the\n\"exact proportions\" asked for in the second case. The exact dimensions\ncannot be given, but 12.6 ft. × 12.6 ft. × 6.3 ft. is a close\napproximation. The cistern will hold a little too much water, at which\nthe buyer will not complain, and it will involve the plumber in a\ntrifling loss not worth considering."}

The height of the shaft of the Nelson column being 200\nfeet and its circumference 16 feet 8 inches, it is wreathed in a spiral\ngarland which passes round it exactly five times.

Of course\nthe height and circumference are not correct, but chosen for the purposes\nof the puzzle. The artist has also intentionally drawn the cylindrical\nshaft of the column of equal circumference throughout. If it were\ntapering, the puzzle would be less easy.", "answer": "If you take a sheet of paper and mark it with a diagonal line, as in\nFigure A, you will find that when you roll it into cylindrical form, with\nthe line outside, it will appear as in Figure B.\nIt will be seen that the spiral (in one complete turn) is merely the\nhypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which the length and width of\nthe paper are the other two sides. In the puzzle given, the lengths of\nthe two sides of the triangle are 40 ft. (one-fifth of 200 ft.) and 16\nft. 8 in. Therefore the hypotenuse is 43 ft. 4 in. The length of the\ngarland is therefore five times as long--216 ft. 8 in.

Therefore, of the twelve ladies,\nsix would be his sisters. Consequently, if twelve could do the work in\nfour and a half months, six ladies would do it in twice the time--four\nand a half months longer--which is the correct answer.\n\nAt first sight there might appear to be some ambiguity about the words,\n\"Everybody kissed everybody else, except, of course, the bashful young\nman himself.\" Might this not be held to imply that all the ladies\nimmodestly kissed the curate, although they were not (except the sisters)\nkissed by him in return?

{"idx": 106, "title": "The Adventurous Snail", "content": "A simple version of the puzzle of the climbing snail is familiar to\neverybody. We were all taught it in the nursery, and it was apparently\nintended to inculcate the simple moral that we should never slip if we\ncan help it. This is the popular story. A snail crawls up a pole 12 feet\nhigh, ascending 3 feet every day and slipping back 2 feet every night.\nHow long does it take to get to the top? Of course, we are expected to\nsay the answer is twelve days, because the creature makes an actual\nadvance of 1 foot in every twenty-four hours. But the modern infant in\narms is not taken in in this way. He says, correctly enough, that at the\nend of the ninth day the snail is 3 feet from the top, and therefore\nreaches the summit of its ambition on the tenth day, for it would cease\nto slip when it had got to the top.\n\nLet us, however, consider the original story. Once upon a time two\nphilosophers were walking in their garden, when one of them espied a\nhighly respectable member of the Helix Aspersa family, a pioneer in\nmountaineering, in the act of making the perilous ascent of a wall 20\nfeet high. Judging by the trail, the gentleman calculated that the snail\nascended 3 feet each day, sleeping and slipping back 2 feet every night.\n\n\"Pray tell me,\" said the philosopher to his friend, who was in the same\nline of business, \"how long will it take Sir Snail to climb to the top of\nthe wall and descend the other side? The top of the wall, as you know,\nhas a sharp edge, so that when he gets there he will instantly begin to\ndescend, putting precisely the same exertion into his daily climbing down\nas he did in his climbing up, and sleeping and slipping at night as\nbefore.\"\n\nThis is the true version of the puzzle, and my readers will perhaps be\ninterested in working out the exact number of days. Of course, in a\npuzzle of this kind the day is always supposed to be equally divided into\ntwelve hours' daytime and twelve hours' night.", "answer": "At the end of seventeen days the snail will have climbed 17 ft., and at\nthe end of its eighteenth day-time task it will be at the top. It\ninstantly begins slipping while sleeping, and will be 2 ft. down the\nother side at the end of the eighteenth day of twenty-four hours. How\nlong will it take over the remaining 18 ft.? If it slips 2 ft. at night\nit clearly overcomes the tendency to slip 2 ft. during the daytime, in\nclimbing up. In rowing up a river we have the stream against us, but in\ncoming down it is with us and helps us. If the snail can climb 3 ft. and\novercome the tendency to slip 2 ft. in twelve hours' ascent, it could\nwith the same exertion crawl 5 ft. a day on the level. Therefore, in\ngoing down, the same exertion carries it 7 ft. in twelve hours--that is,\n5 ft. by personal exertion and 2 ft. by slip. This, with the night slip,\ngives it a descending progress of 9 ft. in the twenty-four hours. It can,\ntherefore, do the remaining 18 ft. in exactly two days, and the whole\njourney, up and down, will take it exactly twenty days."}

It happened that the king one day discovered that his\nfour sons were not only plotting against each other, but were in secret\nrebellion against himself. After consulting with his advisers he decided\nnot to exile the princes, but to confine them to the four corners of the\ncountry, where each should be given a triangular territory of equal area,\nbeyond the boundaries of which they would pass at the cost of their\nlives. Now, the royal surveyor found himself confronted by great natural\ndifficulties, owing to the wild character of the country. The result was\nthat while each was given exactly the same area, the four triangular\ndistricts were all of different shapes, somewhat in the manner shown in\nthe illustration. The puzzle is to give the three measurements for each\nof the four districts in the smallest possible numbers--all whole\nfurlongs. In other words, it is required to find (in the smallest\npossible numbers) four rational right-angled triangles of equal area.", "answer": "When Montucla, in his edition of Ozanam's _Recreations in Mathematics_,\ndeclared that \"No more than three right-angled triangles, equal to each\nother, can be found in whole numbers, but we may find as many as we\nchoose in fractions,\" he curiously overlooked the obvious fact that if\nyou give all your sides a common denominator and then cancel that\ndenominator you have the required answer in integers!\n\nEvery reader should know that if we take any two numbers, _m_ and _n_,\nthen _m_^2 + _n_^2, _m_^2 - _n_^2, and _2mn_ will be the three sides of a\nrational right-angled triangle. Here _m_ and _n_ are called generating\nnumbers. To form three such triangles of equal area, we use the following\nsimple formula, where _m_ is the greater number:--\n\n  _mn_ + _m_^2 + _n_^2 = _a_\n  _m_^2 - _n_^2 = _b_\n  2_mn_ + _n_^2 = _c_\n\nNow, if we form three triangles from the following pairs of generators,\n_a_ and _b_, _a_ and _c_, _a_ and _b_ + _c_, they will all be of equal\narea. This is the little problem respecting which Lewis Carroll says in\nhis diary (see his _Life and Letters_ by Collingwood, p. 343), \"Sat up\nlast night till 4 a.m., over a tempting problem, sent me from New York,\n'to find three equal rational-sided right-angled triangles.' I found two\n... but could not find three!\"\n\nThe following is a subtle formula by means of which we may always find a\nR.A.T. equal in area to any given R.A.T. Let _z_ = hypotenuse, _b_ =\nbase, _h_ = height, _a_ = area of the given triangle; then all we have\nto do is to form a R.A.T. from the generators _z_^2 and 4_a_, and give\neach side the denominator 2_z_ (_b_^2 - _h_^2), and we get the required\nanswer in fractions. If we multiply all three sides of the original\ntriangle by the denominator, we shall get at once a solution in whole\nnumbers.\n\nThe answer to our puzzle in smallest possible numbers is as follows:--\n\n  First Prince ...  518   1320   1418\n  Second Prince ... 280   2442   2458\n  Third Prince ...  231   2960   2969\n  Fourth Prince ... 111   6160   6161\n\nThe area in every case is 341,880 square furlongs. I must here refrain\nfrom showing fully how I get these figures. I will explain, however, that\nthe first three triangles are obtained, in the manner shown, from the\nnumbers 3 and 4, which give the generators 37, 7; 37, 33; 37, 40. These\nthree pairs of numbers solve the indeterminate equation, _a_^3_b_\n-_b_^3_a_ = 341,880. If we can find another pair of values, the thing is\ndone. These values are 56, 55, which generators give the last triangle.\nThe next best answer that I have found is derived from 5 and 6, which\ngive the generators 91, 11; 91, 85; 91, 96. The fourth pair of values is\n63, 42.\n\nThe reader will understand from what I have written above that there is\nno limit to the number of rational-sided R.A.T.'s of equal area that may\nbe found in whole numbers."}

At ten o'clock at night he dismissed\nthe servants, saying that he had some important business matters to look\ninto, and would be sitting up late. He would require no attendance. It\nwas supposed that after all had gone to bed he had admitted some person\nto the house, for one of the servants was positive that she had heard\nloud conversation at a very late hour.\n\nNext morning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, one of the man-servants, on\nentering the room, found Mr. Mowbray lying on the floor, shot through the\nhead, and quite dead. Now we come to the curious circumstance of the\ncase. It was clear that after the bullet had passed out of the dead man's\nhead it had struck the tall clock in the room, right in the very centre\nof the face, and actually welded together the three hands; for the clock\nhad a seconds hand that revolved round the same dial as the hour and\nminute hands. But although the three hands had become welded together\nexactly as they stood in relation to each other at the moment of impact,\nyet they were free to revolve round the swivel in one piece, and had been\nstupidly spun round several times by the servants before Mr. Wiley Slyman\nwas called upon the spot. But they would not move separately.\nNow, inquiries by the police in the neighbourhood led to the arrest in\nLondon of a stranger who was identified by several persons as having been\nseen in the district the day before the murder, but it was ascertained\nbeyond doubt at what time on the fateful morning he went away by train.\nIf the crime took place after his departure, his innocence was\nestablished. For this and other reasons it was of the first importance to\nfix the exact time of the pistol shot, the sound of which nobody in the\nhouse had heard. The clock face in the illustration shows exactly how the\nhands were found. Mr. Slyman was asked to give the police the benefit of\nhis sagacity and experience, and directly he was shown the clock he\nsmiled and said:\n\n\"The matter is supremely simple. You will notice that the three hands\nappear to be at equal distances from one another. The hour hand, for\nexample, is exactly twenty minutes removed from the minute hand--that is,\nthe third of the circumference of the dial. You attach a lot of\nimportance to the fact that the servants have been revolving the welded\nhands, but their act is of no consequence whatever; for although they\nwere welded instantaneously, as they are free on the swivel, they would\nswing round of themselves into equilibrium. Give me a few moments, and I\ncan tell you beyond any doubt the exact time that the pistol was fired.\"\n\nMr. Wiley Slyman took from his pocket a notebook, and began to figure it\nout. In a few minutes he handed the police inspector a slip of paper, on\nwhich he had written the precise moment of the crime. The stranger was\nproved to be an old enemy of Mr. Mowbray's, was convicted on other\nevidence that was discovered; but before he paid the penalty for his\nwicked act, he admitted that Mr. Slyman's statement of the time was\nperfectly correct.\n\nCan you also give the exact time?", "answer": "We were told that the bullet that killed Mr. Stanton Mowbray struck the\nvery centre of the clock face and instantly welded together the hour,\nminute, and second hands, so that all revolved in one piece. The puzzle\nwas to tell from the fixed relative positions of the three hands the\nexact time when the pistol was fired.\n\nWe were also told, and the illustration of the clock face bore out the\nstatement, that the hour and minute hands were exactly twenty divisions\napart, \"the third of the circumference of the dial.\" Now, there are\neleven times in twelve hours when the hour hand is exactly twenty\ndivisions ahead of the minute hand, and eleven times when the minute hand\nis exactly twenty divisions ahead of the hour hand. The illustration\nshowed that we had only to consider the former case. If we start at four\no'clock, and keep on adding 1 h. 5 m. 27-3/11 sec., we shall get all\nthese eleven times, the last being 2 h. 54 min. 32-8/11 sec. Another\naddition brings us back to four o'clock. If we now examine the clock\nface, we shall find that the seconds hand is nearly twenty-two divisions\nbehind the minute hand, and if we look at all our eleven times we shall\nfind that only in the last case given above is the seconds hand at this\ndistance. Therefore the shot must have been fired at 2 h. 54 min. 32-8/11\nsec. exactly, or, put the other way, at 5 min. 27-3/11 sec. to three\no'clock. This is the correct and only possible answer to the puzzle."}
{"idx": 113, "title": "Cutting a Wood Block", "content": "An economical carpenter had a block of wood measuring eight inches long\nby four inches wide by three and three-quarter inches deep. How many\npieces, each measuring two and a half inches by one inch and a half by\none inch and a quarter, could he cut out of it? It is all a question of\nhow you cut them out. Most people would have more waste material left\nover than is necessary. How many pieces could you get out of the block?", "answer": "Though the cubic contents are sufficient for twenty-five pieces, only\ntwenty-four can actually be cut from the block. First reduce the length\nof the block by half an inch. The smaller piece cut off constitutes the\nportion that cannot be used. Cut the larger piece into three slabs, each\none and a quarter inch thick, and it will be found that eight blocks may\neasily be cut out of each slab without any further waste."}
{"idx": 114, "title": "The Tramps and the Biscuits", "content": "Four merry tramps bought, borrowed, found, or in some other manner\nobtained possession of a box of biscuits, which they agreed to divide\nequally amongst themselves at breakfast next morning. In the night, while\nthe others were fast asleep under the greenwood tree, one man approached\nthe box, devoured exactly a quarter of the number of biscuits, except the\nodd one left over, which he threw as a bribe to their dog. Later in the\nnight a second man awoke and hit on the same idea, taking a quarter of\nwhat remained and giving the odd biscuit to the dog. The third and fourth\nmen did precisely the same in turn, taking a quarter of what they found\nand giving the odd biscuit to the dog. In the morning they divided what\nremained equally amongst them, and again gave the odd biscuit to the\nanimal. Every man noticed the reduction in the contents of the box, but,\nbelieving himself to be alone responsible, made no comments. What is the\nsmallest possible number of biscuits that there could have been in the\nbox when they first acquired it?", "answer": "The smallest number of biscuits must have been 1021, from which it is\nevident that they were of that miniature description that finds favour in\nthe nursery. The general solution is that for _n_ men the number must be\n_m_ (_n_^{_n_+1}) - (_n_ - 1), where _m_ is any integer. Each man will\nreceive _m_ (_n_ - 1)^_n_ - 1 biscuits at the final division, though in\nthe case of two men, when _m_ = 1, the final distribution only benefits\nthe dog. Of course, in every case each man steals an _n_th of the number\nof biscuits, after giving the odd one to the dog."}
