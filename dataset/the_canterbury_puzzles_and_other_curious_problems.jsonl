{"idx": 1, "title": "The Reve's Puzzle", "content": "The Reve was a wily man and something of a scholar. As Chaucer tells us,\n\"There was no auditor could of him win,\" and \"there could no man bring\nhim in arrear.\" The poet also noticed that \"ever he rode the hindermost\nof the route.\" This he did that he might the better, without\ninterruption, work out the fanciful problems and ideas that passed\nthrough his active brain. When the pilgrims were stopping at a wayside\ntavern, a number of cheeses of varying sizes caught his alert eye; and\ncalling for four stools, he told the company that he would show them a\npuzzle of his own that would keep them amused during their rest. He then\nplaced eight cheeses of graduating sizes on one of the end stools, the\nsmallest cheese being at the top, as clearly shown in the illustration.\n\"This is a riddle,\" quoth he, \"that I did once set before my fellow\ntownsmen at Baldeswell, that is in Norfolk, and, by Saint Joce, there\nwas no man among them that could rede it aright. And yet it is withal\nfull easy, for all that I do desire is that, by the moving of one cheese\nat a time from one stool unto another, ye shall remove all the cheeses to\nthe stool at the other end without ever putting any cheese on one that is\nsmaller than itself. To him that will perform this feat in the least\nnumber of moves that be possible will I give a draught of the best that\nour good host can provide.\" To solve this puzzle in the fewest possible\nmoves, first with 8, then with 10, and afterwards with 21 cheeses, is an\ninteresting recreation.", "answer": "The 8 cheeses can be removed in 33 moves, 10 cheeses in 49 moves, and 21\ncheeses in 321 moves. I will give my general method of solution in the\ncases of 3, 4, and 5 stools.\n\nWrite out the following table to any required length:--\n\n  Stools.      Number of Cheeses.\n\n  3      1  2  3   4   5    6    7      Natural Numbers.\n  4      1  3  6  10  15   21   28      Triangular Numbers.\n  5      1  4 10  20  35   56   84      Triangular Pyramids.\n\n         Number of Moves.\n\n  3      1  3  7  15  31   63  127\n  4      1  5 17  49 129  321  769\n  5      1  7 31 111 351 1023 2815\n\nThe first row contains the natural numbers. The second row is found by\nadding the natural numbers together from the beginning. The numbers in\nthe third row are obtained by adding together the numbers in the second\nrow from the beginning. The fourth row contains the successive powers of\n2, less 1. The next series is found by doubling in turn each number of\nthat series and adding the number that stands above the place where you\nwrite the result. The last row is obtained in the same way. This table\nwill at once give solutions for any number of cheeses with three stools,\nfor triangular numbers with four stools, and for pyramidal numbers with\nfive stools. In these cases there is always only one method of\nsolution--that is, of piling the cheeses.\n\nIn the case of three stools, the first and fourth rows tell us that 4\ncheeses may be removed in 15 moves, 5 in 31, 7 in 127. The second and\nfifth rows show that, with four stools, 10 may be removed in 49, and 21\nin 321 moves. Also, with five stools, we find from the third and sixth\nrows that 20 cheeses require 111 moves, and 35 cheeses 351 moves. But we\nalso learn from the table the necessary method of piling. Thus, with four\nstools and 10 cheeses, the previous column shows that we must make piles\nof 6 and 3, which will take 17 and 7 moves respectively--that is, we\nfirst pile the six smallest cheeses in 17 moves on one stool; then we\npile the next 3 cheeses on another stool in 7 moves; then remove the\nlargest cheese in 1 move; then replace the 3 in 7 moves; and finally\nreplace the 6 in 17: making in all the necessary 49 moves. Similarly we\nare told that with five stools 35 cheeses must form piles of 20, 10, and\n4, which will respectively take 111, 49, and 15 moves.\n\nIf the number of cheeses in the case of four stools is not triangular,\nand in the case of five stools pyramidal, then there will be more than\none way of making the piles, and subsidiary tables will be required. This\nis the case with the Reve's 8 cheeses. But I will leave the reader to\nwork out for himself the extension of the problem."}

He first\nfilled the 5-pint and 3-pint measures, and then, turning the tap, allowed\nthe barrel to run to waste--a proceeding against which the company\nprotested; but the wily man showed that he was aware that the cask did\nnot contain much more than eight pints of ale. The contents, however, do\nnot affect the solution of the puzzle. He then closed the tap and emptied\nthe 3-pint into the barrel; filled the 3-pint from the 5-pint; emptied\nthe 3-pint into the barrel; transferred the two pints from the 5-pint to\nthe 3-pint; filled the 5-pint from the barrel, leaving one pint now in\nthe barrel; filled 3-pint from 5-pint; allowed the company to drink the\ncontents of the 3-pint; filled the 3-pint from the 5-pint, leaving one\npint now in the 5-pint; drank the contents of the 3-pint; and finally\ndrew off one pint from the barrel into the 3-pint.

Prithee tell me how many\nthere must perforce have been in the company.\" The Merchant clearly\nrequired the smallest number of persons that could so ride in the\nsixty-four ways.", "answer": "This puzzle amounts to finding the smallest possible number that has\nexactly sixty-four divisors, counting 1 and the number itself as\ndivisors. The least number is 7,560. The pilgrims might, therefore, have\nridden in single file, two and two, three and three, four and four, and\nso on, in exactly sixty-four different ways, the last manner being in a\nsingle row of 7,560.\n\nThe Merchant was careful to say that they were going over a common, and\nnot to mention its size, for it certainly would not be possible along an\nordinary road!\n\nTo find how many different numbers will divide a given number, N, let N =\n_a_^p _b_^q _c_^r ..., where _a_, _b_, _c_ ... are prime numbers. Then\nthe number of divisors will be (_p_ + 1) (_q_ + 1) (_r_ + 1) ..., which\nincludes as divisors 1 and N itself.

But it is important sometimes to note whether or not\nthe condition is that there shall be a given number of divisors _and no\nmore_. For example, the smallest number that has seven divisors and no\nmore is 64, while 24 has eight divisors, and might equally fulfil the\nconditions.

There be excellent bread and cheese in the pantry.\"", "answer": "There were four portions of warden pie and four portions of venison pasty\nto be distributed among eight out of eleven guests. But five out of the\neleven will only eat the pie, four will only eat the pasty, and two are\nwilling to eat of either. Any possible combination must fall into one of\nthe following groups. (i.) Where the warden pie is distributed entirely\namong the five first mentioned; (ii.) where only one of the accommodating\npair is given pie; (iii.) where the other of the pair is given pie; (iv.)\nwhere both of the pair are given pie. The numbers of combinations are:\n(i.) = 75, (ii.) = 50, (iii.) = 10, (iv.) = 10--making in all 145 ways of\nselecting the eight participants. A great many people will give the\nanswer as 185, by overlooking the fact that in forty cases in class\n(iii.) precisely the same eight guests would be sharing the meal as in\nclass (ii.), though the accommodating pair would be eating differently of\nthe two dishes. This is the point that upset the calculations of the\ncompany."}
{"idx": 16, "title": "The Sompnour's Puzzle", "content": "The Sompnour, or Summoner, who, according to Chaucer, joined the party of\npilgrims, was an officer whose duty was to summon delinquents to appear\nin ecclesiastical courts. In later times he became known as the\napparitor. Our particular individual was a somewhat quaint though worthy\nman. \"He was a gentle hireling and a kind; A better fellow should a man\nnot find.\" In order that the reader may understand his appearance in the\npicture, it must be explained that his peculiar headgear is duly recorded\nby the poet. \"A garland had he set upon his head, As great as if it were\nfor an ale-stake.\"\nOne evening ten of the company stopped at a village inn and requested to\nbe put up for the night, but mine host could only accommodate five of\nthem. The Sompnour suggested that they should draw lots, and as he had\nhad experience in such matters in the summoning of juries and in other\nways, he arranged the company in a circle and proposed a \"count out.\"\nBeing of a chivalrous nature, his little plot was so to arrange that the\nmen should all fall out and leave the ladies in possession. He therefore\ngave the Wife of Bath a number and directed her to count round and round\nthe circle, in a clockwise direction, and the person on whom that number\nfell was immediately to step out of the ring. The count then began afresh\nat the next person. But the lady misunderstood her instructions, and\nselected in mistake the number eleven and started the count at herself.\nAs will be found, this resulted in all the women falling out in turn\ninstead of the men, for every eleventh person withdrawn from the circle\nis a lady.\n\n\"Of a truth it was no fault of mine,\" said the Sompnour next day to the\ncompany, \"and herein is methinks a riddle. Can any tell me what number\nthe good Wife should have used withal, and at which pilgrim she should\nhave begun her count so that no other than the five men should have been\ncounted out?\" Of course, the point is to find the smallest number that\nwill have the desired effect.", "answer": "The number that the Sompnour confided to the Wife of Bath was\ntwenty-nine, and she was told to begin her count at the Doctor of Physic,\nwho will be seen in the illustration standing the second on her right.\nThe first count of twenty-nine falls on the Shipman, who steps out of the\nring. The second count falls on the Doctor, who next steps out. The\nremaining three counts fall respectively on the Cook, the Sompnour, and\nthe Miller. The ladies would, therefore, have been left in possession had\nit not been for the unfortunate error of the good Wife. Any multiple of\n2,520 added to 29 would also have served the same purpose, beginning the\ncount at the Doctor."}

Nine kennels have I for the use of my\ndogs, and they be put in the form of a square; though the one in the\nmiddle I do never use, it not being of a useful nature. Now the riddle is\nto find in how many different ways I may place my dogs in all or any of\nthe outside kennels so that the number of dogs on every side of the\nsquare may be just ten.\" The small diagrams show four ways of doing it,\nand though the fourth way is merely a reversal of the third, it counts as\ndifferent. Any kennels may be left empty. This puzzle was evidently a\nvariation of the ancient one of the Abbess and her Nuns.", "answer": "The Monk might have placed dogs in the kennels in two thousand nine\nhundred and twenty-six different ways, so that there should be ten dogs\non every side. The number of dogs might vary from twenty to forty, and\nas long as the Monk kept his animals within these limits the thing was\nalways possible.\n\nThe general solution to this puzzle is difficult. I find that for _n_\ndogs on every side of the square, the number of different ways is (_n_^4\n+ 10_n_^3 + 38_n_^2 + 62_n_ + 33) / 48, where _n_ is odd, and ((_n_^4 +\n10_n_^3 + 38_n_^2 + 68_n_) / 48) + 1, where _n_ is even, if we count only\nthose arrangements that are fundamentally different. But if we count all\nreversals and reflections as different, as the Monk himself did, then _n_\ndogs (odd or even) may be placed in ((_n_^4 + 6_n_^3 + 14_n_^2 + 15_n_) /\n6) + 1 ways. In order that there may be _n_ dogs on every side, the\nnumber must not be less than 2_n_ nor greater than 4_n_, but it may be\nany number within these limits.\n\nAn extension of the principle involved in this puzzle is given in No. 42,\n\"The Riddle of the Pilgrims.\""}

Our text-books tell us that all\nspheres are similar, and that similar solids are as the cubes of\ncorresponding lengths. Therefore, as the circumferences of the two phials\nwere one foot and two feet respectively and the cubes of one and two\nadded together make nine, what we have to find is two other numbers whose\ncubes added together make nine.

He produced a piece of cloth in the shape of a\nperfect equilateral triangle, as shown in the illustration, and said, \"Be\nthere any among ye full wise in the true cutting of cloth?

But the curious point of the puzzle is that I have found that\nthe feat may really be performed in so few as four pieces, and without\nturning over any piece when placing them together. The method of doing\nthis is subtle, but I think the reader will find the problem a most\ninteresting one.", "answer": "The illustration will show how the triangular piece of cloth may be cut\ninto four pieces that will fit together and form a perfect square.

If you have done this accurately,\nyou will now have the required directions for the cuts.\nI exhibited this problem before the Royal Society, at Burlington House,\non 17th May 1905, and also at the Royal Institution in the following\nmonth, in the more general form:--\"A New Problem on Superposition: a\ndemonstration that an equilateral triangle can be cut into four pieces\nthat may be reassembled to form a square, with some examples of a general\nmethod for transforming all rectilinear triangles into squares by\ndissection.\" It was also issued as a challenge to the readers of the\n_Daily Mail_ (see issues of 1st and 8th February 1905), but though many\nhundreds of attempts were sent in there was not a single solver. Credit,\nhowever, is due to Mr. C. W. M'Elroy, who alone sent me the correct\nsolution when I first published the problem in the _Weekly Dispatch_ in\n1902.\n\nI add an illustration showing the puzzle in a rather curious practical\nform, as it was made in polished mahogany with brass hinges for use by\ncertain audiences.

{"idx": 28, "title": "The Great Dispute between the Friar and the Sompnour", "content": "Chaucer records the painful fact that the harmony of the pilgrimage was\nbroken on occasions by the quarrels between the Friar and the Sompnour.\nAt one stage the latter threatened that ere they reached Sittingbourne he\nwould make the Friar's \"heart for to mourn;\" but the worthy Host\nintervened and patched up a temporary peace. Unfortunately trouble broke\nout again over a very curious dispute in this way.\nAt one point of the journey the road lay along two sides of a square\nfield, and some of the pilgrims persisted, in spite of trespass, in\ncutting across from corner to corner, as they are seen to be doing in the\nillustration. Now, the Friar startled the company by stating that there\nwas no need for the trespass, since one way was exactly the same distance\nas the other! \"On my faith, then,\" exclaimed the Sompnour, \"thou art a\nvery fool!\" \"Nay,\" replied the Friar, \"if the company will but listen\nwith patience, I shall presently show how that thou art the fool, for\nthou hast not wit enough in thy poor brain to prove that the diagonal of\nany square is less than two of the sides.\"\n\nIf the reader will refer to the diagrams that we have given, he will be\nable to follow the Friar's argument. If we suppose the side of the field\nto be 100 yards, then the distance along the two sides, A to B, and B to\nC, is 200 yards. He undertook to prove that the diagonal distance direct\nfrom A to C is also 200 yards. Now, if we take the diagonal path shown in\nFig. 1, it is evident that we go the same distance, for every one of the\neight straight portions of this path measures exactly 25 yards. Similarly\nin Fig. 2, the zigzag contains ten straight portions, each 20 yards long:\nthat path is also the same length--200 yards. No matter how many steps we\nmake in our zigzag path, the result is most certainly always the same.\nThus, in Fig. 3 the steps are very small, yet the distance must be 200\nyards; as is also the case in Fig. 4, and would yet be if we needed a\nmicroscope to detect the steps. In this way, the Friar argued, we may go\non straightening out that zigzag path until we ultimately reach a\nperfectly straight line, and it therefore follows that the diagonal of a\nsquare is of exactly the same length as two of the sides.\nNow, in the face of it, this must be wrong; and it is in fact absurdly\nso, as we can at once prove by actual measurement if we have any doubt.\nYet the Sompnour could not for the life of him point out the fallacy, and\nso upset the Friar's reasoning. It was this that so exasperated him, and\nconsequently, like many of us to-day when we get entangled in an\nargument, he utterly lost his temper and resorted to abuse. In fact, if\nsome of the other pilgrims had not interposed the two would have\nundoubtedly come to blows. The reader will perhaps at once see the flaw\nin the Friar's argument.", "answer": "In this little problem we attempted to show how, by sophistical\nreasoning, it may apparently be proved that the diagonal of a square is\nof precisely the same length as two of the sides. The puzzle was to\ndiscover the fallacy, because it is a very obvious fallacy if we admit\nthat the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But\nwhere does the error come in?\n\nWell, it is perfectly true that so long as our zigzag path is formed of\n\"steps\" parallel to the sides of the square that path must be of the same\nlength as the two sides. It does not matter if you have to use the most\npowerful microscope obtainable; the rule is always true if the path is\nmade up of steps in that way. But the error lies in the assumption that\nsuch a zigzag path can ever become a straight line. You may go on\nincreasing the number of steps infinitely--that is, there is no limit\nwhatever theoretically to the number of steps that can be made--but you\ncan never reach a straight line by such a method. In fact it is just as\nmuch a \"jump\" to a straight line if you have a billion steps as it is at\nthe very outset to pass from the two sides to the diagonal. It would be\njust as absurd to say we might go on dropping marbles into a basket until\nthey become sovereigns as to say we can increase the number of our steps\nuntil they become a straight line. There is the whole thing in a\nnutshell."}
{"idx": 29, "title": "Chaucer's Puzzle", "content": "Chaucer himself accompanied the pilgrims. Being a mathematician and a man\nof a thoughtful habit, the Host made fun of him, he tells us, saying,\n\"Thou lookest as thou wouldst find a hare, For ever on the ground I see\nthee stare.\" The poet replied to the request for a tale by launching into\na long-spun-out and ridiculous poem, intended to ridicule the popular\nromances of the day, after twenty-two stanzas of which the company\nrefused to hear any more, and induced him to start another tale in prose.\nIt is an interesting fact that in the \"Parson's Prologue\" Chaucer\nactually introduces a little astronomical problem. In modern English\nthis reads somewhat as follows:--\n\n\"The sun from the south line was descended so low that it was not to my\nsight more than twenty-nine degrees. I calculate that it was four\no'clock, for, assuming my height to be six feet, my shadow was eleven\nfeet, a little more or less. At the same moment the moon's altitude (she\nbeing in mid-Libra) was steadily increasing as we entered at the west end\nof the village.\" A correspondent has taken the trouble to work this out,\nand finds that the local time was 3.58 p.m., correct to a minute, and\nthat the day of the year was the 22nd or 23rd of April, modern style.\nThis speaks well for Chaucer's accuracy, for the first line of the Tales\ntells us that the pilgrimage was in April--they are supposed to have set\nout on 17th April 1387, as stated in No. 23.\n\nThough Chaucer made this little puzzle and recorded it for the interest\nof his readers, he did not venture to propound it to his fellow-pilgrims.\nThe puzzle that he gave them was of a simpler kind altogether: it may be\ncalled a geographical one. \"When, in the year 1372, I did go into Italy\nas the envoy of our sovereign lord King Edward the Third, and while there\ndid visit Francesco Petrarch, that learned poet did take me to the top of\na certain mountain in his country. Of a truth, as he did show me, a mug\nwill hold less liquor at the top of this mountain than in the valley\nbeneath. Prythee tell me what mountain this may be that has so strange a\nproperty withal.\" A very elementary knowledge of geography will suffice\nfor arriving at the correct answer.", "answer": "The surface of water or other liquid is always spherical, and the greater\nany sphere is the less is its convexity. Hence the top diameter of any\nvessel at the summit of a mountain will form the base of the segment of a\ngreater sphere than it would at the bottom. This sphere, being greater,\nmust (from what has been already said) be less convex; or, in other\nwords, the spherical surface of the water must be less above the brim of\nthe vessel, and consequently it will hold less at the top of a mountain\nthan at the bottom. The reader is therefore free to select any mountain\nhe likes in Italy--or elsewhere!"}
{"idx": 30, "title": "The Puzzle of the Canon's Yeoman", "content": "This person joined the party on the road. \"'God save,' quoth he, 'this\njolly company! Fast have I ridden,' saith he, 'for your sake, Because I\nwould I might you overtake, To ride among this merry company.'\" Of\ncourse, he was asked to entertain the pilgrims with a puzzle, and the one\nhe propounded was the following. He showed them the diamond-shaped\narrangement of letters presented in the accompanying illustration, and\nsaid, \"I do call it the rat-catcher's riddle. In how many different ways\ncanst thou read the words, 'Was it a rat I saw?'\" You may go in any\ndirection backwards and forwards, upwards or downwards, only the\nsuccessive letters in any reading must always adjoin one another.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n              W\n            W A W\n          W A S A W\n        W A S I S A W\n      W A S I T I S A W\n    W A S I T A T I S A W\n  W A S I T A R A T I S A W\n    W A S I T A T I S A W\n      W A S I T I S A W\n        W A S I S A W\n          W A S A W\n            W A W\n              W      ]", "answer": "The number of different ways is 63,504. The general formula for such\narrangements, when the number of letters in the sentence is 2_n_ + 1, and\nit is a palindrome without diagonal readings, is [4(2^_n_ - 1)]^2.\n\nI think it will be well to give here a formula for the general solution\nof each of the four most common forms of the diamond-letter puzzle. By\nthe word \"line\" I mean the complete diagonal. Thus in A, B, C, and D, the\nlines respectively contain 5, 5, 7, and 9 letters. A has a non-palindrome\nline (the word being BOY), and the general solution for such cases, where\nthe line contains 2_n_ + 1 letters, is 4(2^_n_ - 1). Where the line is a\nsingle palindrome, with its middle letter in the centre, as in B, the\ngeneral formula is [4(2^_n_ - 1)]^{2}. This is the form of the\nRat-catcher's Puzzle, and therefore the expression that I have given\nabove. In cases C and D we have double palindromes, but these two\nrepresent very different types. In C, where the line contains 4^n-1\nletters, the general expression is 4^(2^{2_n_}-2). But D is by far the\nmost difficult case of all.\n\nI had better here state that in the diamonds under consideration (i.) no\ndiagonal readings are allowed--these have to be dealt with specially in\ncases where they are possible and admitted; (ii.) readings may start\nanywhere; (iii.) readings may go backwards and forwards, using letters\nmore than once in a single reading, but not the same letter twice in\nimmediate succession. This last condition will be understood if the\nreader glances at C, where it is impossible to go forwards and backwards\nin a reading without repeating the first O touched--a proceeding which I\nhave said is not allowed. In the case D it is very different, and this is\nwhat accounts for its greater difficulty. The formula for D is this:\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  (_n_+5)×2^{2_n_+2} + (2^{_n_+2}×(1×3×5×7\n  . . . . . (2n-1)) / _n_) - 2^{_n_+4} - 8   ]\n\nwhere the number of letters in the line is 4_n_+1. In the example given\nthere are therefore 400 readings for _n_ = 2."}
{"idx": 31, "title": "The Manciple's Puzzle", "content": "The Manciple was an officer who had the care of buying victuals for an\nInn of Court--like the Temple. The particular individual who accompanied\nthe party was a wily man who had more than thirty masters, and made fools\nof them all. Yet he was a man \"whom purchasers might take as an example\nHow to be wise in buying of their victual.\"\n\nIt happened that at a certain stage of the journey the Miller and the\nWeaver sat down to a light repast. The Miller produced five loaves and\nthe Weaver three. The Manciple coming upon the scene asked permission to\neat with them, to which they agreed. When the Manciple had fed he laid\ndown eight pieces of money and said with a sly smile, \"Settle betwixt\nyourselves how the money shall be fairly divided. 'Tis a riddle for thy\nwits.\"\n\nA discussion followed, and many of the pilgrims joined in it. The Reve\nand the Sompnour held that the Miller should receive five pieces and the\nWeaver three, the simple Ploughman was ridiculed for suggesting that the\nMiller should receive seven and the Weaver only one, while the Carpenter,\nthe Monk, and the Cook insisted that the money should be divided equally\nbetween the two men. Various other opinions were urged with considerable\nvigour, until it was finally decided that the Manciple, as an expert in\nsuch matters, should himself settle the point. His decision was quite\ncorrect. What was it? Of course, all three are supposed to have eaten\nequal shares of the bread.\nPUZZLING TIMES AT SOLVAMHALL CASTLE\nEverybody that has heard of Solvamhall Castle, and of the quaint customs\nand ceremonies that obtained there in the olden times, is familiar with\nthe fact that Sir Hugh de Fortibus was a lover of all kinds of puzzles\nand enigmas. Sir Robert de Riddlesdale himself declared on one occasion,\n\"By the bones of Saint Jingo, this Sir Hugh hath a sharp wit. Certes, I\nwot not the riddle that he may not rede withal.\" It is, therefore, a\nsource of particular satisfaction that the recent discovery of some\nancient rolls and documents relating mainly to the family of De Fortibus\nenables me to place before my readers a few of the posers that racked\npeople's brains in the good old days. The selection has been made to suit\nall tastes, and while the majority will be found sufficiently easy to\ninterest those who like a puzzle that _is_ a puzzle, but well within the\nscope of all, two that I have included may perhaps be found worthy of\nengaging the attention of the more advanced student of these things.", "answer": "The simple Ploughman, who was so ridiculed for his opinion, was perfectly\ncorrect: the Miller should receive seven pieces of money, and the Weaver\nonly one. As all three ate equal shares of the bread, it should be\nevident that each ate 8/3 of a loaf. Therefore, as the Miller provided\n15/3 and ate 8/3, he contributed 7/3 to the Manciple's meal; whereas the\nWeaver provided 9/3, ate 8/3, and contributed only 1/3. Therefore, since\nthey contributed to the Manciple in the proportion of 7 to 1, they must\ndivide the eight pieces of money in the same proportion.\n\nPUZZLING TIMES AT SOLVAMHALL CASTLE\n\n_SIR HUGH EXPLAINS HIS PROBLEMS_\n\nThe friends of Sir Hugh de Fortibus were so perplexed over many of his\nstrange puzzles that at a gathering of his kinsmen and retainers he\nundertook to explain his posers.\n\"Of a truth,\" said he, \"some of the riddles that I have put forth would\ngreatly tax the wit of the unlettered knave to rede; yet will I try to\nshow the manner thereof in such way that all may have understanding.

{"idx": 32, "title": "The Game of Bandy-Ball", "content": "Bandy-ball, cambuc, or goff (the game so well known to-day by the name of\ngolf), is of great antiquity, and was a special favourite at Solvamhall\nCastle. Sir Hugh de Fortibus was himself a master of the game, and he\nonce proposed this question.\n\nThey had nine holes, 300, 250, 200, 325, 275, 350, 225, 375, and 400\nyards apart. If a man could always strike the ball in a perfectly\nstraight line and send it exactly one of two distances, so that it would\neither go towards the hole, pass over it, or drop into it, what would the\ntwo distances be that would carry him in the least number of strokes\nround the whole course?\n\n\"Beshrew me,\" Sir Hugh would say, \"if I know any who could do it in this\nperfect way; albeit, the point is a pretty one.\"\n\nTwo very good distances are 125 and 75, which carry you round in 28\nstrokes, but this is not the correct answer. Can the reader get round in\nfewer strokes with two other distances?", "answer": "Sir Hugh explained, in answer to this puzzle, that as the nine holes were\n300, 250, 200, 325, 275, 350, 225, 375, and 400 yards apart, if a man\ncould always strike the ball in a perfectly straight line and send it at\nwill a distance of either 125 yards or 100 yards, he might go round the\nwhole course in 26 strokes. This is clearly correct, for if we call the\n125 stroke the \"drive\" and the 100 stroke the \"approach,\" he could play\nas follows:--The first hole could be reached in 3 approaches, the second\nin 2 drives, the third in 2 approaches, the fourth in 2 approaches and 1\ndrive, the fifth in 3 drives and 1 backward approach, the sixth in 2\ndrives and 1 approach, the seventh in 1 drive and 1 approach, the eighth\nin 3 drives, and the ninth hole in 4 approaches. There are thus 26\nstrokes in all, and the feat cannot be performed in fewer."}
{"idx": 33, "title": "Tilting at the Ring", "content": "Another favourite sport at the castle was tilting at the ring. A\nhorizontal bar was fixed in a post, and at the end of a hanging supporter\nwas placed a circular ring, as shown in the above illustrated title. By\nraising or lowering the bar the ring could be adjusted to the proper\nheight--generally about the level of the left eyebrow of the horseman.\nThe object was to ride swiftly some eighty paces and run the lance\nthrough the ring, which was easily detached, and remained on the lance as\nthe property of the skilful winner. It was a very difficult feat, and men\nwere not unnaturally proud of the rings they had succeeded in capturing.\n\nAt one tournament at the castle Henry de Gournay beat Stephen Malet by\nsix rings. Each had his rings made into a chain--De Gournay's chain being\nexactly sixteen inches in length, and Malet's six inches. Now, as the\nrings were all of the same size and made of metal half an inch thick, the\nlittle puzzle proposed by Sir Hugh was to discover just how many rings\neach man had won.", "answer": "\"By my halidame!\" exclaimed Sir Hugh, \"if some of yon varlets had been\nput in chains, which for their sins they do truly deserve, then would\nthey well know, mayhap, that the length of any chain having like rings is\nequal to the inner width of a ring multiplied by the number of rings and\nadded to twice the thickness of the iron whereof it is made. It may be\nshown that the inner width of the rings used in the tilting was one inch\nand two-thirds thereof, and the number of rings Stephen Malet did win\nwas three, and those that fell to Henry de Gournay would be nine.\"\n\nThe knight was quite correct, for 1-2/3 in. × 3 + 1 in. = 6 in., and\n1-2/3 in. x 9 + 1 in. = 16 in. Thus De Gournay beat Malet by six rings.\nThe drawing showing the rings may assist the reader in verifying the\nanswer and help him to see why the inner width of a link multiplied by\nthe number of links and added to twice the thickness of the iron gives\nthe exact length. It will be noticed that every link put on the chain\nloses a length equal to twice the thickness of the iron."}
{"idx": 34, "title": "The Noble Demoiselle", "content": "Seated one night in the hall of the castle, Sir Hugh desired the company\nto fill their cups and listen while he told the tale of his adventure as\na youth in rescuing from captivity a noble demoiselle who was languishing\nin the dungeon of the castle belonging to his father's greatest enemy.\nThe story was a thrilling one, and when he related the final escape from\nall the dangers and horrors of the great Death's-head Dungeon with the\nfair but unconscious maiden in his arms, all exclaimed, \"'Twas marvellous\nvaliant!\" But Sir Hugh said, \"I would never have turned from my purpose,\nnot even to save my body from the bernicles.\"\nSir Hugh then produced a plan of the thirty-five cells in the dungeon and\nasked his companions to discover the particular cell that the demoiselle\noccupied. He said that if you started at one of the outside cells and\npassed through every doorway once, and once only, you were bound to end\nat the cell that was sought. Can you find the cell? Unless you start at\nthe correct outside cell it is impossible to pass through all the\ndoorways once and once only. Try tracing out the route with your pencil.", "answer": "\"Some here have asked me,\" continued Sir Hugh, \"how they may find the\ncell in the Dungeon of the Death's-head wherein the noble maiden was\ncast. Beshrew me! but 'tis easy withal when you do but know how to do it.\nIn attempting to pass through every door once, and never more, you must\ntake heed that every cell hath two doors or four, which be even numbers,\nexcept two cells, which have but three. Now, certes, you cannot go in and\nout of any place, passing through all the doors once and no more, if the\nnumber of doors be an odd number. But as there be but two such odd cells,\nyet may we, by beginning at the one and ending at the other, so make our\njourney in many ways with success. I pray you, albeit, to mark that only\none of these odd cells lieth on the outside of the dungeon, so we must\nperforce start therefrom. Marry, then, my masters, the noble demoiselle\nmust needs have been wasting in the other.\"\n\nThe drawing will make this quite clear to the reader. The two \"odd cells\"\nare indicated by the stars, and one of the many routes that will solve\nthe puzzle is shown by the dotted line. It is perfectly certain that you\nmust start at the lower star and end at the upper one; therefore the cell\nwith the star situated over the left eye must be the one sought."}
{"idx": 35, "title": "The Archery Butt", "content": "The butt or target used in archery at Solvamhall was not marked out in\nconcentric rings as at the present day, but was prepared in fanciful\ndesigns. In the illustration is shown a numbered target prepared by Sir\nHugh himself. It is something of a curiosity, because it will be found\nthat he has so cleverly arranged the numbers that every one of the twelve\nlines of three adds up to exactly twenty-two.\n\nOne day, when the archers were a little tired of their sport, Sir Hugh de\nFortibus said, \"What ho, merry archers! Of a truth it is said that a\nfool's bolt is soon shot, but, by my faith, I know not any man among you\nwho shall do that which I will now put forth. Let these numbers that are\nupon the butt be set down afresh, so that the twelve lines thereof shall\nmake twenty and three instead of twenty and two.\"\nTo rearrange the numbers one to nineteen so that all the twelve lines\nshall add up to twenty-three will be found a fascinating puzzle. Half the\nlines are, of course, on the sides, and the others radiate from the\ncentre.", "answer": "\"It hath been said that the proof of a pudding is ever in the eating\nthereof, and by the teeth of Saint George I know no better way of showing\nhow this placing of the figures may be done than by the doing of it.\nTherefore have I in suchwise written the numbers that they do add up to\ntwenty and three in all the twelve lines of three that are upon the\nbutt.\"\n\nI think it well here to supplement the solution of De Fortibus with a few\nremarks of my own. The nineteen numbers may be so arranged that the lines\nwill add up to any number we may choose to select from 22 to 38\ninclusive, excepting 30. In some cases there are several different\nsolutions, but in the case of 23 there are only two. I give one of these.\nTo obtain the second solution exchange respectively 7, 10, 5, 8, 9, in\nthe illustration, with 13, 4, 17, 2, 15. Also exchange 18 with 12, and\nthe other numbers may remain unmoved. In every instance there must be an\neven number in the central place, and any such number from 2 to 18 may\noccur. Every solution has its complementary. Thus, if for every number in\nthe accompanying drawing we substitute the difference between it and 20,\nwe get the solution in the case of 37. Similarly, from the arrangement in\nthe original drawing, we may at once obtain a solution for the case of\n38."}
{"idx": 36, "title": "The Donjon Keep Window", "content": "On one occasion Sir Hugh greatly perplexed his chief builder.

I trow thou art but a sorry craftsman if thou canst not,\nforsooth, set such a window in a keep wall.\"\n\nIt will be noticed that Sir Hugh ignores the thickness of the bars.", "answer": "In this case Sir Hugh had greatly perplexed his chief builder by\ndemanding that he should make a window measuring one foot on every side\nand divided by bars into eight lights, having all their sides equal. The\nillustration will show how this was to be done. It will be seen that if\neach side of the window measures one foot, then each of the eight\ntriangular lights is six inches on every side.\n\n\"Of a truth, master builder,\" said De Fortibus slyly to the architect, \"I\ndid not tell thee that the window must be square, as it is most certain\nit never could be.\""}
{"idx": 37, "title": "The Crescent and the Cross", "content": "When Sir Hugh's kinsman, Sir John de Collingham, came back from the Holy\nLand, he brought with him a flag bearing the sign of a crescent, as shown\nin the illustration. It was noticed that De Fortibus spent much time in\nexamining this crescent and comparing it with the cross borne by the\nCrusaders on their own banners. One day, in the presence of a goodly\ncompany, he made the following striking announcement:--\n\n\"I have thought much of late, friends and masters, of the conversion of\nthe crescent to the cross, and this has led me to the finding of matters\nat which I marvel greatly, for that which I shall now make known is\nmystical and deep. Truly it was shown to me in a dream that this crescent\nof the enemy may be exactly converted into the cross of our own banner.\nHerein is a sign that bodes good for our wars in the Holy Land.\"\nSir Hugh de Fortibus then explained that the crescent in one banner might\nbe cut into pieces that would exactly form the perfect cross in the\nother. It is certainly rather curious; and I show how the conversion from\ncrescent to cross may be made in ten pieces, using every part of the\ncrescent. The flag was alike on both sides, so pieces may be turned over\nwhere required.", "answer": "\"By the toes of St. Moden,\" exclaimed Sir Hugh de Fortibus when this\npuzzle was brought up, \"my poor wit hath never shaped a more cunning\nartifice or any more bewitching to look upon. It came to me as in a\nvision, and ofttimes have I marvelled at the thing, seeing its exceeding\ndifficulty. My masters and kinsmen, it is done in this wise.\"\nThe worthy knight then pointed out that the crescent was of a particular\nand somewhat irregular form--the two distances _a_ to _b_ and _c_ to _d_\nbeing straight lines, and the arcs _ac_ and _bd_ being precisely similar.\nHe showed that if the cuts be made as in Figure 1, the four pieces will\nfit together and form a perfect square, as shown in Figure 2, if we there\nonly regard the three curved lines. By now making the straight cuts also\nshown in Figure 2, we get the ten pieces that fit together, as in Figure\n3, and form a perfectly symmetrical Greek cross. The proportions of the\ncrescent and the cross in the original illustration were correct, and\nthe solution can be demonstrated to be absolutely exact and not merely\napproximate.\n\nI have a solution in considerably fewer pieces, but it is far more\ndifficult to understand than the above method, in which the problem is\nsimplified by introducing the intermediate square."}
{"idx": 38, "title": "The Amulet", "content": "A strange man was one day found loitering in the courtyard of the castle,\nand the retainers, noticing that his speech had a foreign accent,\nsuspected him of being a spy. So the fellow was brought before Sir Hugh,\nwho could make nothing of him. He ordered the varlet to be removed and\nexamined, in order to discover whether any secret letters were concealed\nabout him. All they found was a piece of parchment securely suspended\nfrom the neck, bearing this mysterious inscription:--\n\n[Illustration:\n\n            A\n           B B\n          R R R\n         A A A A\n        C C C C C\n       A A A A A A\n      D D D D D D D\n     A A A A A A A A\n    B B B B B B B B B\n   R R R R R R R R R R\n  A A A A A A A A A A A   ]\n\nTo-day we know that Abracadabra was the supreme deity of the Assyrians,\nand this curious arrangement of the letters of the word was commonly worn\nin Europe as an amulet or charm against diseases.

{"idx": 39, "title": "The Snail on the Flagstaff", "content": "It would often be interesting if we could trace back to their origin many\nof the best known puzzles. Some of them would be found to have been first\npropounded in very ancient times, and there can be very little doubt that\nwhile a certain number may have improved with age, others will have\ndeteriorated and even lost their original point and bearing. It is\ncurious to find in the Solvamhall records our familiar friend the\nclimbing snail puzzle, and it will be seen that in its modern form it has\nlost its original subtlety.\nOn the occasion of some great rejoicings at the Castle, Sir Hugh was\nsuperintending the flying of flags and banners, when somebody pointed out\nthat a wandering snail was climbing up the flagstaff. One wise old fellow\nsaid:--\n\n\"They do say, Sir Knight, albeit I hold such stories as mere fables, that\nthe snail doth climb upwards three feet in the daytime, but slippeth back\ntwo feet by night.\"\n\"Then,\" replied Sir Hugh, \"tell us how many days it will take this snail\nto get from the bottom to the top of the pole.\"\n\n\"By bread and water, I much marvel if the same can be done unless we take\ndown and measure the staff.\"\n\n\"Credit me,\" replied the knight, \"there is no need to measure the staff.\"\n\nCan the reader give the answer to this version of a puzzle that we all\nknow so well?", "answer": "Though there was no need to take down and measure the staff, it is\nundoubtedly necessary to find its height before the answer can be given.\nIt was well known among the friends and retainers of Sir Hugh de Fortibus\nthat he was exactly six feet in height. It will be seen in the original\npicture that Sir Hugh's height is just twice the length of his shadow.\nTherefore we all know that the flagstaff will, at the same place and time\nof day, be also just twice as long as its shadow. The shadow of the staff\nis the same length as Sir Hugh's height; therefore this shadow is six\nfeet long, and the flagstaff must be twelve feet high. Now, the snail, by\nclimbing up three feet in the daytime and slipping back two feet by\nnight, really advances one foot in a day of twenty-four hours. At the end\nof nine days it is three feet from the top, so that it reaches its\njourney's end on the tenth day.\n\nThe reader will doubtless here exclaim, \"This is all very well; but how\nwere we to know the height of Sir Hugh? It was never stated how tall he\nwas!\" No, it was not stated in so many words, but it was none the less\nclearly indicated to the reader who is sharp in these matters. In the\noriginal illustration to the donjon keep window Sir Hugh is shown\nstanding against a wall, the window in which is stated to be one foot\nsquare on the inside.

{"idx": 40, "title": "Lady Isabel's Casket", "content": "Sir Hugh's young kinswoman and ward, Lady Isabel de Fitzarnulph, was\nknown far and wide as \"Isabel the Fair.\" Amongst her treasures was a\ncasket, the top of which was perfectly square in shape. It was inlaid\nwith pieces of wood, and a strip of gold ten inches long by a quarter of\nan inch wide.\n\nWhen young men sued for the hand of Lady Isabel, Sir Hugh promised his\nconsent to the one who would tell him the dimensions of the top of the\nbox from these facts alone: that there was a rectangular strip of gold,\nten inches by 1/4-inch; and the rest of the surface was exactly inlaid\nwith pieces of wood, each piece being a perfect square, and no two pieces\nof the same size. Many young men failed, but one at length succeeded. The\npuzzle is not an easy one, but the dimensions of that strip of gold,\ncombined with those other conditions, absolutely determine the size of\nthe top of the casket.\n\nTHE MERRY MONKS OF RIDDLEWELL\n\nTHEIR QUAINT PUZZLES AND ENIGMAS.\n\"Friar Andrew,\" quoth the Lord Abbot, as he lay a-dying, \"methinks I\ncould now rede thee the riddle of riddles--an I had--the time--and--\" The\ngood friar put his ear close to the holy Abbot's lips, but alas! they\nwere silenced for ever. Thus passed away the life of the jovial and\ngreatly beloved Abbot of the old monastery of Riddlewell.\n\nThe monks of Riddlewell Abbey were noted in their day for the quaint\nenigmas and puzzles that they were in the habit of propounding. The Abbey\nwas built in the fourteenth century, near a sacred spring known as the\nRed-hill Well. This became in the vernacular Reddlewell and Riddlewell,\nand under the Lord Abbot David the monks evidently tried to justify the\nlatter form by the riddles they propounded so well. The solving of\npuzzles became the favourite recreation, no matter whether they happened\nto be of a metaphysical, philosophical, mathematical, or mechanical kind.\nIt grew into an absorbing passion with them, and as I have shown above,\nin the case of the Abbot this passion was strong even in death.\n\nIt would seem that the words \"puzzle,\" \"problem,\" \"enigma,\" etc., did not\noccur in their vocabulary. They were accustomed to call every poser a\n\"riddle,\" no matter whether it took the form of \"Where was Moses when the\nlight went out?\" or the Squaring of the Circle. On one of the walls in\nthe refectory were inscribed the words of Samson, \"I will now put forth\na riddle to you,\" to remind the brethren of what was expected of them,\nand the rule was that each monk in turn should propose some riddle weekly\nto the community, the others being always free to cap it with another if\ndisposed to do so. Abbot David was, undoubtedly, the puzzle genius of the\nmonastery, and everybody naturally bowed to his decision. Only a few of\nthe Abbey riddles have been preserved, and I propose to select those that\nseem most interesting. I shall try to make the conditions of the puzzles\nperfectly clear, so that the modern reader may fully understand them, and\nbe amused in trying to find some of the solutions.", "answer": "The last puzzle was undoubtedly a hard nut, but perhaps difficulty does\nnot make a good puzzle any the less interesting when we are shown the\nsolution. The accompanying diagram indicates exactly how the top of Lady\nIsabel de Fitzarnulph's casket was inlaid with square pieces of rare wood\n(no two squares alike) and the strip of gold 10 inches by a quarter of an\ninch. This is the only possible solution, and it is a singular fact\n(though I cannot here show the subtle method of working) that the number,\nsizes, and order of those squares are determined by the given dimensions\nof the strip of gold, and the casket can have no other dimensions than 20\ninches square. The number in a square indicates the length in inches of\nthe side of that square, so the accuracy of the answer can be checked\nalmost at a glance.\n\nSir Hugh de Fortibus made some general concluding remarks on the occasion\nthat are not altogether uninteresting to-day.\n\"Friends and retainers,\" he said, \"if the strange offspring of my poor\nwit about which we have held pleasant counsel to-night hath mayhap had\nsome small interest for ye, let these matters serve to call to mind the\nlesson that our fleeting life is rounded and beset with enigmas. Whence\nwe came and whither we go be riddles, and albeit such as these we may\nnever bring within our understanding, yet there be many others with which\nwe and they that do come after us will ever strive for the answer.\nWhether success do attend or do not attend our labour, it is well that we\nmake the attempt; for 'tis truly good and honourable to train the mind,\nand the wit, and the fancy of man, for out of such doth issue all manner\nof good in ways unforeseen for them that do come after us.\"\n\nTHE MERRY MONKS OF RIDDLEWELL"}
{"idx": 41, "title": "The Riddle of the Fish-pond", "content": "At the bottom of the Abbey meads was a small fish-pond where the monks\nused to spend many a contemplative hour with rod and line. One day, when\nthey had had very bad luck and only caught twelve fishes amongst them,\nBrother Jonathan suddenly declared that as there was no sport that day\nhe would put forth a riddle for their entertainment. He thereupon took\ntwelve fish baskets and placed them at equal distances round the pond, as\nshown in our illustration, with one fish in each basket.\n\n\"Now, gentle anglers,\" said he, \"rede me this riddle of the Twelve\nFishes. Start at any basket you like, and, always going in one direction\nround the pond, take up one fish, pass it over two other fishes, and\nplace it in the next basket. Go on again; take up another single fish,\nand, having passed that also over two fishes, place it in a basket; and\nso continue your journey. Six fishes only are to be removed, and when\nthese have been placed, there should be two fishes in each of six\nbaskets, and six baskets empty. Which of you merry wights will do this in\nsuch a manner that you shall go round the pond as few times as possible?\"\n\nI will explain to the reader that it does not matter whether the two\nfishes that are passed over are in one or two baskets, nor how many empty\nbaskets you pass. And, as Brother Jonathan said, you must always go in\none direction round the pond (without any doubling back) and end at the\nspot from which you set out.", "answer": "Number the fish baskets in the illustration from 1 to 12 in the direction\nthat Brother Jonathan is seen to be going. Starting from 1, proceed as\nfollows, where \"1 to 4\" means, take the fish from basket No. 1 and\ntransfer it to basket No. 4:--\n\n1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, 3 to 6, 7 to 10, 11 to 2, and complete the last\nrevolution to 1, making three revolutions in all. Or you can proceed this\nway:--\n\n4 to 7, 8 to 11, 12 to 3, 2 to 5, 6 to 9, 10 to 1.\n\nIt is easy to solve in four revolutions, but the solutions in three are\nmore difficult to discover."}
{"idx": 42, "title": "The Riddle of the Pilgrims", "content": "One day, when the monks were seated at their repast, the Abbot announced\nthat a messenger had that morning brought news that a number of pilgrims\nwere on the road and would require their hospitality.\n\n\"You will put them,\" he said, \"in the square dormitory that has two\nfloors with eight rooms on each floor. There must be eleven persons\nsleeping on each side of the building, and twice as many on the upper\nfloor as on the lower floor. Of course every room must be occupied, and\nyou know my rule that not more than three persons may occupy the same\nroom.\"\n\nI give a plan of the two floors, from which it will be seen that the\nsixteen rooms are approached by a well staircase in the centre. After the\nmonks had solved this little problem and arranged for the accommodation,\nthe pilgrims arrived, when it was found that they were three more in\nnumber than was at first stated. This necessitated a reconsideration of\nthe question, but the wily monks succeeded in getting over the new\ndifficulty without breaking the Abbot's rules. The curious point of this\npuzzle is to discover the total number of pilgrims.\n\nPLAN OF DORMITORY.\n\n[Illustration: Eight Rooms on Upper Floor.]\n\n[Illustration: Eight Rooms on Lower Floor.]", "answer": "If it were not for the Abbot's conditions that the number of guests in\nany room may not exceed three, and that every room must be occupied, it\nwould have been possible to accommodate either 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, or\n42 pilgrims. But to accommodate 24 pilgrims so that there shall be twice\nas many sleeping on the upper floor as on the lower floor, and eleven\npersons on each side of the building, it will be found necessary to leave\nsome of the rooms empty. If, on the other hand, we try to put up 33, 36,\n39 or 42 pilgrims, we shall find that in every case we are obliged to\nplace more than three persons in some of the rooms. Thus we know that the\nnumber of pilgrims originally announced (whom, it will be remembered, it\nwas possible to accommodate under the conditions of the Abbot) must have\nbeen 27, and that, since three more than this number were actually\nprovided with beds, the total number of pilgrims was 30. The accompanying\ndiagram shows how they might be arranged, and if in each instance we\nregard the upper floor as placed above the lower one, it will be seen\nthat there are eleven persons on each side of the building, and twice as\nmany above as below."}
{"idx": 43, "title": "The Riddle of the Tiled Hearth", "content": "It seems that it was Friar Andrew who first managed to \"rede the riddle\nof the Tiled Hearth.\" Yet it was a simple enough little puzzle. The\nsquare hearth, where they burnt their Yule logs and round which they had\nsuch merry carousings, was floored with sixteen large ornamental tiles.\nWhen these became cracked and burnt with the heat of the great fire, it\nwas decided to put down new tiles, which had to be selected from four\ndifferent patterns (the Cross, the Fleur-de-lys, the Lion, and the Star);\nbut plain tiles were also available. The Abbot proposed that they should\nbe laid as shown in our sketch, without any plain tiles at all; but\nBrother Richard broke in,--\n\n\"I trow, my Lord Abbot, that a riddle is required of me this day. Listen,\nthen, to that which I shall put forth. Let these sixteen tiles be so\nplaced that no tile shall be in line with another of the same\ndesign\"--(he meant, of course, not in line horizontally, vertically, or\ndiagonally)--\"and in such manner that as few plain tiles as possible be\nrequired.\" When the monks handed in their plans it was found that only\nFriar Andrew had hit upon the correct answer, even Friar Richard himself\nbeing wrong. All had used too many plain tiles.", "answer": "The correct answer is shown in the illustration on page 196. No tile is\nin line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with another\ntile of the same design, and only three plain tiles are used. If after\nplacing the four lions you fall into the error of placing four other\ntiles of another pattern, instead of only three, you will be left with\nfour places that must be occupied by plain tiles. The secret consists in\nplacing four of one kind and only three of each of the others."}
{"idx": 44, "title": "The Riddle of the Sack Wine", "content": "One evening, when seated at table, Brother Benjamin was called upon by\nthe Abbot to give the riddle that was that day demanded of him.\n\n\"Forsooth,\" said he, \"I am no good at the making of riddles, as thou\nknowest full well; but I have been teasing my poor brain over a matter\nthat I trust some among you will expound to me, for I cannot rede it\nmyself. It is this. Mark me take a glass of sack from this bottle that\ncontains a pint of wine and pour it into that jug which contains a pint\nof water. Now, I fill the glass with the mixture from the jug and pour it\nback into the bottle holding the sack. Pray tell me, have I taken more\nwine from the bottle than water from the jug? Or have I taken more water\nfrom the jug than wine from the bottle?\"\n\nI gather that the monks got nearer to a great quarrel over this little\nposer than had ever happened before. One brother so far forgot himself as\nto tell his neighbour that \"more wine had got into his pate than wit came\nout of it,\" while another noisily insisted that it all depended on the\nshape of the glass and the age of the wine. But the Lord Abbot\nintervened, showed them what a simple question it really was, and\nrestored good feeling all round.", "answer": "The question was: Did Brother Benjamin take more wine from the bottle\nthan water from the jug? Or did he take more water from the jug than wine\nfrom the bottle? He did neither. The same quantity of wine was\ntransferred from the bottle as water was taken from the jug. Let us\nassume that the glass would hold a quarter of a pint. There was a pint of\nwine in the bottle and a pint of water in the jug. After the first\nmanipulation the bottle contains three-quarters of a pint of wine, and\nthe jug one pint of water mixed with a quarter of a pint of wine. Now,\nthe second transaction consists in taking away a fifth of the contents of\nthe jug--that is, one-fifth of a pint of water mixed with one-fifth of a\nquarter of a pint of wine. We thus leave behind in the jug four-fifths of\na quarter of a pint of wine--that is, one-fifth of a pint--while we\ntransfer from the jug to the bottle an equal quantity (one-fifth of a\npint) of water."}
{"idx": 45, "title": "The Riddle of the Cellarer", "content": "Then Abbot David looked grave, and said that this incident brought to his\nmind the painful fact that John the Cellarer had been caught robbing the\ncask of best Malvoisie that was reserved for special occasions. He\nordered him to be brought in.\n\"Now, varlet,\" said the Abbot, as the ruddy-faced Cellarer came before\nhim, \"thou knowest that thou wast taken this morning in the act of\nstealing good wine that was forbidden thee. What hast thou to say for\nthyself?\"\n\n\"Prithee, my Lord Abbot, forgive me!\" he cried, falling on his knees. \"Of\na truth, the Evil One did come and tempt me, and the cask was so handy,\nand the wine was so good withal, and--and I had drunk of it ofttimes\nwithout being found out, and--\"\n\n\"Rascal! that but maketh thy fault the worse! How much wine hast thou\ntaken?\"\n\n\"Alack-a-day! There were a hundred pints in the cask at the start, and I\nhave taken me a pint every day this month of June--it being to-day the\nthirtieth thereof--and if my Lord Abbot can tell me to a nicety how much\ngood wine I have taken in all, let him punish me as he will.\"\n\n\"Why, knave, that is thirty pints.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; for each time I drew a pint out of the cask, I put in a pint\nof water in its stead!\"\n\nIt is a curious fact that this is the only riddle in the old record that\nis not accompanied by its solution. Is it possible that it proved too\nhard a nut for the monks? There is merely the note, \"John suffered no\npunishment for his sad fault.\"", "answer": "There were 100 pints of wine in the cask, and on thirty occasions John\nthe Cellarer had stolen a pint and replaced it with a pint of water.\nAfter the first theft the wine left in the cask would be 99 pints; after\nthe second theft the wine in the cask would be 9801/100 pints (the square\nof 99 divided by 100); after the third theft there would remain\n970299/10000 (the cube of 99 divided by the square of 100); after the\nfourth theft there would remain the fourth power of 99 divided by the\ncube of 100; and after the thirtieth theft there would remain in the cask\nthe thirtieth power of 99 divided by the twenty-ninth power of 100. This\nby the ordinary method of calculation gives us a number composed of 59\nfigures to be divided by a number composed of 58 figures! But by the use\nof logarithms it may be quickly ascertained that the required quantity is\nvery nearly 73-97/100 pints of wine left in the cask. Consequently the\ncellarer stole nearly 26.03 pints. The monks doubtless omitted the answer\nfor the reason that they had no tables of logarithms, and did not care to\nface the task of making that long and tedious calculation in order to get\nthe quantity \"to a nicety,\" as the wily cellarer had stipulated.\n\nBy a simplified process of calculation, I have ascertained that the exact\nquantity of wine stolen would be\n\n  26.0299626611719577269984907683285057747323737647323555652999\n\npints.

They may move in any order one step at a\ntime, or jumping over one of the opposite colour to the place beyond,\njust as we play draughts to-day. The only other condition is that when\nall the frogs have changed sides, the 1 must be where the 12 now is and\nthe 12 in the place now occupied by 1. The puzzle was to perform the feat\nin as few moves as possible. How many moves are necessary?\n\nI will conclude in the words of the old writer: \"These be some of the\nriddles which the monks of Riddlewell did set forth and expound each to\nthe others in the merry days of the good Abbot David.\"\n\nTHE STRANGE ESCAPE OF THE KING'S JESTER.\n\n_A PUZZLING ADVENTURE._\n\nAt one time I was greatly in favour with the king, and his Majesty never\nseemed to weary of the companionship of the court fool.

Luckily my\nwit did save my life. I begged that I might be slain by the royal hand\nand not by that of the executioner.\n\n\"By the saints,\" said his Majesty, \"what difference can it make unto\nthee? But since it is thy wish, thou shalt have thy choice whether I kill\nthee or the executioner.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" I answered, \"I accept the choice that thou hast so\ngraciously offered to me: I prefer that your Majesty should kill the\nexecutioner.\"\n\nYet is the life of a royal jester beset with great dangers, and the king\nhaving once gotten it into his royal head that I was a wizard, it was not\nlong before I again fell into trouble, from which my wit did not a second\ntime in a like way save me. I was cast into the dungeon to await my\ndeath. How, by the help of my gift in answering riddles and puzzles, I\ndid escape from captivity I will now set forth; and in case it doth\nperplex any to know how some of the strange feats were performed, I will\nhereafter make the manner thereof plain to all.", "answer": "The fewest possible moves in which this puzzle can be solved are 118. I\nwill give the complete solution. The black figures on white discs move\nin the directions of the hands of a clock, and the white figures on black\ndiscs the other way. The following are the numbers in the order in which\nthey move. Whether you have to make a simple move or a leaping move will\nbe clear from the position, as you never can have an alternative. The\nmoves enclosed in brackets are to be played five times over: 6, 7, 8, 6,\n5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), 6,\n5, 4, 3, 2, 12, (7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2,\n12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4, 3, 2, 10, 11, 2. We\nthus have made 118 moves within the conditions, the black frogs have\nchanged places with the white ones, and 1 and 12 are side by side in the\npositions stipulated.\n\nThe general solution in the case of this puzzle is 3_n_^{2} + 2_n_ - 2\nmoves, where the number of frogs of each colour is _n_. The law governing\nthe sequence of moves is easily discovered by an examination of the\nsimpler cases, where _n_ = 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIf, instead of 11 and 12 changing places, the 6 and 7 must interchange,\nthe expression is _n_^{2} + 4_n_ + 2 moves. If we give _n_ the value 6,\nas in the example of the Frogs' Ring, the number of moves would be 62.\n\nFor a general solution of the case where frogs of one colour reverse\ntheir order, leaving the blank space in the same position, and each frog\nis allowed to be moved in either direction (leaping, of course, over his\nown colour), see \"The Grasshopper Puzzle\" in _A. in M._, p. 193.\n\nTHE STRANGE ESCAPE OF THE KING'S JESTER\n\nAlthough the king's jester promised that he would \"thereafter make the\nmanner thereof plain to all,\" there is no record of his having ever done\nso.

{"idx": 49, "title": "The Mysterious Rope", "content": "My dungeon did not lie beneath the moat, but was in one of the most high\nparts of the castle. So stout was the door, and so well locked and\nsecured withal, that escape that way was not to be found. By hard work I\ndid, after many days, remove one of the bars from the narrow window, and\nwas able to crush my body through the opening; but the distance to the\ncourtyard below was so exceeding great that it was certain death to drop\nthereto. Yet by great good fortune did I find in the corner of the cell a\nrope that had been there left and lay hid in the great darkness. But this\nrope had not length enough, and to drop in safety from the end was nowise\npossible. Then did I remember how the wise man from Ireland did lengthen\nthe blanket that was too short for him by cutting a yard off the bottom\nof the same and joining it on to the top. So I made haste to divide the\nrope in half and to tie the two parts thereof together again. It was then\nfull long, and did reach the ground, and I went down in safety. How could\nthis have been?", "answer": "When the jester \"divided his rope in half,\" it does not follow that he\ncut it into two parts, each half the original length of the rope. No\ndoubt he simply untwisted the strands, and so divided it into two ropes,\neach of the original length, but one-half the thickness.

Before the handle\nof the door might be turned, it was needful to place the hands of three\nseveral dials in their proper places. If you but knew the proper letter\nfor each dial, the secret was of a truth to your hand; but as ten letters\nwere upon the face of every dial, you might try nine hundred and\nninety-nine times and only succeed on the thousandth attempt withal. If I\nwas indeed to escape I must waste not a moment.\n\nNow, once had I heard the learned monk who did invent the lock say that\nhe feared that the king's servants, having such bad memories, would\nmayhap forget the right letters; so perchance, thought I, he had on this\naccount devised some way to aid their memories. And what more natural\nthan to make the letters form some word? I soon found a word that was\nEnglish, made of three letters--one letter being on each of the three\ndials. After that I had pointed the hands properly to the letters the\ndoor opened and I passed out. What was the secret word?", "answer": "This puzzle entailed the finding of an English word of three letters,\neach letter being found on a different dial. Now, there is no English\nword composed of consonants alone, and the only vowel appearing anywhere\non the dials is Y. No English word begins with Y and has the two other\nletters consonants, and all the words of three letters ending in Y (with\ntwo consonants) either begin with an S or have H, L, or R as their second\nletter. But these four consonants do not appear. Therefore Y must occur\nin the middle, and the only word that I can find is \"PYX,\" and there can\nbe little doubt that this was the word. At any rate, it solves our\npuzzle."}
{"idx": 52, "title": "Crossing the Moat", "content": "I was now face to face with the castle moat, which was, indeed, very wide\nand very deep. Alas! I could not swim, and my chance of escape seemed of\na truth hopeless, as, doubtless, it would have been had I not espied a\nboat tied to the wall by a rope. But after I had got into it I did find\nthat the oars had been taken away, and that there was nothing that I\ncould use to row me across. When I had untied the rope and pushed off\nupon the water the boat lay quite still, there being no stream or current\nto help me. How, then, did I yet take the boat across the moat?", "answer": "No doubt some of my readers will smile at the statement that a man in a\nboat on smooth water can pull himself across with the tiller rope! But it\nis a fact. If the jester had fastened the end of his rope to the stern of\nthe boat and then, while standing in the bows, had given a series of\nviolent jerks, the boat would have been propelled forward. This has often\nbeen put to a practical test, and it is said that a speed of two or three\nmiles an hour may be attained. See W. W. Rouse Ball's _Mathematical\nRecreations_."}
{"idx": 53, "title": "The Royal Gardens", "content": "It was now daylight, and still had I to pass through the royal gardens\noutside of the castle walls. These gardens had once been laid out by an\nold king's gardener, who had become bereft of his senses, but was allowed\nto amuse himself therein. They were square, and divided into 16 parts by\nhigh walls, as shown in the plan thereof, so that there were openings\nfrom one garden to another, but only two different ways of entrance.\nNow, it was needful that I enter at the gate A and leave by the other\ngate B; but as there were gardeners going and coming about their work, I\nhad to slip with agility from one garden to another, so that I might not\nbe seen, but escape unobserved. I did succeed in so doing, but afterwards\nremembered that I had of a truth entered every one of the 16 gardens\nonce, and never more than once. This was, indeed, a curious thing. How\nmight it have been done?", "answer": "This puzzle must have struck many readers as being absolutely impossible.\nThe jester said: \"I had, of a truth, entered every one of the sixteen\ngardens once, and never more than once.\" If we follow the route shown in\nthe accompanying diagram, we find that there is no difficulty in once\nentering all the gardens but one before reaching the last garden\ncontaining the exit B. The difficulty is to get into the garden with a\nstar, because if we leave the B garden we are compelled to enter it a\nsecond time before escaping, and no garden may be entered twice. The\ntrick consists in the fact that you may enter that starred garden without\nnecessarily leaving the other. If, when the jester got to the gateway\nwhere the dotted line makes a sharp bend, his intention had been to hide\nin the starred garden, but after he had put one foot through the doorway,\nupon the star, he discovered it was a false alarm and withdrew, he could\ntruly say: \"I entered the starred garden, because I put my foot and part\nof my body in it; and I did not enter the other garden twice, because,\nafter once going in I never left it until I made my exit at B.\" This is\nthe only answer possible, and it was doubtless that which the jester\nintended.\n\nSee \"The Languishing Maiden,\" in _A. in M._"}

Looking around for something to\nhelp me over my difficulty, I soon found eight narrow planks of wood\nlying together in a heap. With these alone, and the planks were each no\nmore than 9 feet long, I did at last manage to make a bridge across the\nditch. How was this done?\nBeing now free I did hasten to the house of a friend who provided me with\na horse and a disguise, with which I soon succeeded in placing myself out\nof all fear of capture.\n\nThrough the goodly offices of divers persons at the king's court I did at\nlength obtain the royal pardon, though, indeed, I was never restored to\nthat full favour that was once my joy and pride.\n\nOfttimes have I been asked by many that do know me to set forth to them\nthe strange manner of my escape, which more than one hath deemed to be of\na truth wonderful, albeit the feat was nothing astonishing withal if we\ndo but remember that from my youth upwards I had trained my wit to the\nmaking and answering of cunning enigmas.

When the last century was yet in its\nyouth, there were few men in the west country more widely known and more\ngenerally respected and beloved than he. A born sportsman, his fame\nextended to Exmoor itself, where his daring and splendid riding in\npursuit of the red deer had excited the admiration and envy of\ninnumerable younger huntsmen. But it was in his own parish, and\nparticularly in his own home, that his genial hospitality, generosity,\nand rare jovial humour made him the idol of his friends--and even of his\nrelations, which sometimes means a good deal.\n\nAt Christmas it was always an open house at Stoke Courcy Hall, for if\nthere was one thing more than another upon which Squire Davidge had very\npronounced views, it was on the question of keeping up in a royal fashion\nthe great festival of Yule-tide. \"Hark ye, my lads,\" he would say to his\nsons: \"our country will begin to fall on evil days if ever we grow\nindifferent to the claims of those Christmas festivities that have helped\nto win us the proud name of Merrie England.\" Therefore, when I say that\nChristmas at Stoke Courcy was kept up in the good old happy, rollicking,\nfestive style that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers so dearly\nloved, it will be unnecessary for me to attempt a description. We have a\nfaithful picture of these merry scenes in the _Bracebridge Hall_ of\nWashington Irving. I must confine myself in this sketch to one special\nfeature in the Squire's round of jollification during the season of peace\nand good will.\n\nHe took a curious and intelligent interest in puzzles of every kind, and\nthere was always one night devoted to what was known as \"Squire Davidge's\nPuzzle Party.\" Every guest was expected to come armed with some riddle or\npuzzle for the bewilderment and possible delectation of the company. The\nold gentleman always presented a new watch to the guest who was most\nsuccessful in his answers. It is a pity that all the puzzles were not\npreserved; but I propose to present to my readers a few selected from a\nnumber that have passed down to a surviving member of the family, who has\nkindly allowed me to use them on this occasion. There are some very easy\nones, a few that are moderately difficult, and one hard brain-racker, so\nall should be able to find something to their taste.\n\nThe little record is written in the neat angular hand of a young lady of\nthat day, and the puzzles, the conditions of which I think it best to\ngive mainly in my own words for the sake of greater clearness, appear to\nhave been all propounded on one occasion.", "answer": "The solution to this puzzle is best explained by the illustration. If he\nhad placed his eight planks, in the manner shown, across the angle of the\nditch, he would have been able to cross without much trouble. The king's\njester might thus have well overcome all his difficulties and got safely\naway, as he has told us that he succeeded in doing.\n\nTHE SQUIRE'S CHRISTMAS PUZZLE PARTY\n\n_HOW THE VARIOUS TRICKS WERE DONE_\n\nThe record of one of Squire Davidge's annual \"Puzzle Parties,\" made by\nthe old gentleman's young lady relative, who had often spent a merry\nChristmas at Stoke Courcy Hall, does not contain the solutions of the\nmysteries.

{"idx": 55, "title": "The Three Teacups", "content": "One young lady--of whom our fair historian records with delightful\ninconsequence: \"This Miss Charity Lockyer has since been married to a\ncurate from Taunton Vale\"--placed three empty teacups on a table, and\nchallenged anybody to put ten lumps of sugar in them so that there would\nbe an odd number of lumps in every cup. \"One young man, who has been to\nOxford University, and is studying the law, declared with some heat that,\nbeyond a doubt, there was no possible way of doing it, and he offered to\ngive proof of the fact to the company.\" It must have been interesting to\nsee his face when he was shown Miss Charity's correct answer.", "answer": "Miss Charity Lockyer clearly must have had a trick up her sleeve, and I\nthink it highly probable that it was conceived on the following lines.\nShe proposed that ten lumps of sugar should be placed in three teacups,\nso that there should be an odd number of lumps in every cup. The\nillustration perhaps shows Miss Charity's answer, and the figures on the\ncups indicate the number of lumps that have been separately placed in\nthem. By placing the cup that holds one lump inside the one that holds\ntwo lumps, it can be correctly stated that every cup contains an odd\nnumber of lumps. One cup holds seven lumps, another holds one lump, while\nthe third cup holds three lumps. It is evident that if a cup contains\nanother cup it also contains the contents of that second cup.\n\nThere are in all fifteen different solutions to this puzzle.

{"idx": 57, "title": "The Christmas Geese", "content": "Squire Hembrow, from Weston Zoyland--wherever that may be--proposed the\nfollowing little arithmetical puzzle, from which it is probable that\nseveral somewhat similar modern ones have been derived: Farmer Rouse sent\nhis man to market with a flock of geese, telling him that he might sell\nall or any of them, as he considered best, for he was sure the man knew\nhow to make a good bargain. This is the report that Jabez made, though I\nhave taken it out of the old Somerset dialect, which might puzzle some\nreaders in a way not desired. \"Well, first of all I sold Mr. Jasper\nTyler half of the flock and half a goose over; then I sold Farmer Avent a\nthird of what remained and a third of a goose over; then I sold Widow\nFoster a quarter of what remained and three-quarters of a goose over; and\nas I was coming home, whom should I meet but Ned Collier: so we had a mug\nof cider together at the Barley Mow, where I sold him exactly a fifth of\nwhat I had left, and gave him a fifth of a goose over for the missus.\nThese nineteen that I have brought back I couldn't get rid of at any\nprice.\" Now, how many geese did Farmer Rouse send to market? My humane\nreaders may be relieved to know that no goose was divided or put to any\ninconvenience whatever by the sales.", "answer": "Farmer Rouse sent exactly 101 geese to market. Jabez first sold Mr.\nJasper Tyler half of the flock and half a goose over (that is, 50-1/2 +\n1/2, or 51 geese, leaving 50); he then sold Farmer Avent a third of what\nremained and a third of a goose over (that is, 16-2/3 + 1/3, or 17 geese,\nleaving 33); he then sold Widow Foster a quarter of what remained and\nthree-quarters of a goose over (that is, 8-1/4 + 3/4 or 9 geese, leaving\n24); he next sold Ned Collier a fifth of what he had left and gave him a\nfifth of a goose \"for the missus\" (that is, 4-4/5 + 1/5 or 5 geese,\nleaving 19). He then took these 19 back to his master."}
{"idx": 58, "title": "The Chalked Numbers", "content": "\"We laughed greatly at a pretty jest on the part of Major Trenchard, a\nmerry friend of the Squire's. With a piece of chalk he marked a\ndifferent number on the backs of eight lads who were at the party.\" Then,\nit seems, he divided them in two groups, as shown in the illustration, 1,\n2, 3, 4 being on one side, and 5, 7, 8, 9 on the other. It will be seen\nthat the numbers of the left-hand group add up to 10, while the numbers\nin the other group add up to 29. The Major's puzzle was to rearrange the\neight boys in two new groups, so that the four numbers in each group\nshould add up alike. The Squire's niece asked if the 5 should not be a 6;\nbut the Major explained that the numbers were quite correct if properly\nregarded.", "answer": "This little jest on the part of Major Trenchard is another trick puzzle,\nand the face of the roguish boy on the extreme right, with the figure 9\non his back, showed clearly that he was in the secret, whatever that\nsecret might be. I have no doubt (bearing in mind the Major's hint as to\nthe numbers being \"properly regarded\") that his answer was that depicted\nin the illustration, where boy No. 9 stands on his head and so converts\nhis number into 6. This makes the total 36--an even number--and by making\nboys 3 and 4 change places with 7 and 8, we get 1278 and 5346, the\nfigures of which, in each case, add up to 18. There are just three other\nways in which the boys may be grouped: 1368--2457, 1467--2358, and\n2367--1458."}
{"idx": 59, "title": "Tasting the Plum Puddings", "content": "\"Everybody, as I suppose, knows well that the number of different\nChristmas plum puddings that you taste will bring you the same number of\nlucky days in the new year. One of the guests (and his name has escaped\nmy memory) brought with him a sheet of paper on which were drawn\nsixty-four puddings, and he said the puzzle was an allegory of a sort,\nand he intended to show how we might manage our pudding-tasting with as\nmuch dispatch as possible.\" I fail to fully understand this fanciful and\nrather overstrained view of the puzzle. But it would appear that the\npuddings were arranged regularly, as I have shown them in the\nillustration, and that to strike out a pudding was to indicate that it\nhad been duly tasted. You have simply to put the point of your pencil on\nthe pudding in the top corner, bearing a sprig of holly, and strike out\nall the sixty-four puddings through their centres in twenty-one straight\nstrokes. You can go up or down or horizontally, but not diagonally or\nobliquely; and you must never strike out a pudding twice, as that would\nimply a second and unnecessary tasting of those indigestible dainties.\nBut the peculiar part of the thing is that you are required to taste the\npudding that is seen steaming hot at the end of your tenth stroke, and to\ntaste the one decked with holly in the bottom row the very last of all.", "answer": "The diagram will show how this puzzle is to be solved. It is the only way\nwithin the conditions laid down. Starting at the pudding with holly at\nthe top left-hand corner, we strike out all the puddings in twenty-one\nstraight strokes, taste the steaming hot pudding at the end of the tenth\nstroke, and end at the second sprig of holly.\n\nHere we have an example of a chess rook's path that is not re-entrant,\nbut between two squares that are at the greatest possible distance from\none another. For if it were desired to move, under the condition of\nvisiting every square once and once only, from one corner square to the\nother corner square on the same diagonal, the feat is impossible.\n\nThere are a good many different routes for passing from one sprig of holly\nto the other in the smallest possible number of moves--twenty-one--but I\nhave not counted them. I have recorded fourteen of these, and possibly\nthere are more. Any one of these would serve our purpose, except for the\ncondition that the tenth stroke shall end at the steaming hot pudding.\nThis was introduced to stop a plurality of solutions--called by the maker\nof chess problems \"cooks.\" I am not aware of more than one solution to\nthis puzzle; but as I may not have recorded all the tours, I cannot make a\npositive statement on the point at the time of writing."}
{"idx": 60, "title": "Under the Mistletoe Bough", "content": "\"At the party was a widower who has but lately come into these parts,\"\nsays the record; \"and, to be sure, he was an exceedingly melancholy man,\nfor he did sit away from the company during the most part of the evening.\nWe afterwards heard that he had been keeping a secret account of all the\nkisses that were given and received under the mistletoe bough. Truly, I\nwould not have suffered any one to kiss me in that manner had I known\nthat so unfair a watch was being kept.

All the bachelors and boys kissed all the maidens and girls\ntwice. The widower did not kiss anybody, and the widows did not kiss each\nother. The puzzle was to ascertain just how many kisses had been thus\ngiven under the mistletoe bough, assuming, as it is charitable to do,\nthat every kiss was returned--the double act being counted as one kiss.", "answer": "Everybody was found to have kissed everybody else once under the\nmistletoe, with the following additions and exceptions: No male kissed a\nmale; no man kissed a married woman except his own wife; all the\nbachelors and boys kissed all the maidens and girls twice; the widower\ndid not kiss anybody, and the widows did not kiss each other. Every kiss\nwas returned, and the double performance was to count as one kiss. In\nmaking a list of the company, we can leave out the widower altogether,\nbecause he took no part in the osculatory exercise.\n\n  7 Married couples       14\n  3 Widows                 3\n  12 Bachelors and Boys   12\n  10 Maidens and Girls    10\n  Total                   39 Persons\n\nNow, if every one of these 39 persons kissed everybody else once, the\nnumber of kisses would be 741; and if the 12 bachelors and boys each\nkissed the 10 maidens and girls once again, we must add 120, making a\ntotal of 861 kisses. But as no married man kissed a married woman other\nthan his own wife, we must deduct 42 kisses; as no male kissed another\nmale, we must deduct 171 kisses; and as no widow kissed another widow, we\nmust deduct 3 kisses. We have, therefore, to deduct 42+171+3=216 kisses\nfrom the above total of 861, and the result, 645, represents exactly the\nnumber of kisses that were actually given under the mistletoe bough."}
{"idx": 61, "title": "The Silver Cubes", "content": "The last extract that I will give is one that will, I think, interest\nthose readers who may find some of the above puzzles too easy. It is a\nhard nut, and should only be attempted by those who flatter themselves\nthat they possess strong intellectual teeth.\n\n\"Master Herbert Spearing, the son of a widow lady in our parish, proposed\na puzzle in arithmetic that looks simple, but nobody present was able to\nsolve it. Of a truth I did not venture to attempt it myself, after the\nyoung lawyer from Oxford, who they say is very learned in the mathematics\nand a great scholar, failed to show us the answer. He did assure us that\nhe believed it could not be done, but I have since been told that it is\npossible, though, of a certainty, I may not vouch for it. Master Herbert\nbrought with him two cubes of solid silver that belonged to his mother.\nHe showed that, as they measured two inches every way, each contained\neight cubic inches of silver, and therefore the two contained together\nsixteen cubic inches. That which he wanted to know was--'Could anybody\ngive him exact dimensions for two cubes that should together contain just\nseventeen cubic inches of silver?'\" Of course the cubes may be of\ndifferent sizes.\nThe idea of a Christmas Puzzle Party, as devised by the old Squire, seems\nto have been excellent, and it might well be revived at the present day\nby people who are fond of puzzles and who have grown tired of Book Teas\nand similar recent introductions for the amusement of evening parties.\nPrizes could be awarded to the best solvers of the puzzles propounded by\nthe guests.\n\nAdventures of the Puzzle Club\nWhen it recently became known that the bewildering mystery of the Prince\nand the Lost Balloon was really solved by the members of the Puzzle Club,\nthe general public was quite unaware that any such club existed. The fact\nis that the members always deprecated publicity; but since they have been\ndragged into the light in connection with this celebrated case, so many\nabsurd and untrue stories have become current respecting their doings\nthat I have been permitted to publish a correct account of some of their\nmore interesting achievements. It was, however, decided that the real\nnames of the members should not be given.\n\nThe club was started a few years ago to bring together those interested\nin the solution of puzzles of all kinds, and it contains some of the\nprofoundest mathematicians and some of the most subtle thinkers resident\nin London. These have done some excellent work of a high and dry kind.\nBut the main body soon took to investigating the problems of real life\nthat are perpetually cropping up.\n\nIt is only right to say that they take no interest in crimes as such, but\nonly investigate a case when it possesses features of a distinctly\npuzzling character. They seek perplexity for its own sake--something to\nunravel. As often as not the circumstances are of no importance to\nanybody, but they just form a little puzzle in real life, and that is\nsufficient.", "answer": "There is no limit to the number of different dimensions that will give\ntwo cubes whose sum shall be exactly seventeen cubic inches. Here is the\nanswer in the smallest possible numbers. One of the silver cubes must\nmeasure 2-23278/40831 inches along each edge, and the other must measure\n11663/40831 inch. If the reader likes to undertake the task of cubing\neach number (that is, multiply each number twice by itself), he will find\nthat when added together the contents exactly equal seventeen cubic\ninches."}
{"idx": 62, "title": "The Ambiguous Photograph", "content": "A good example of the lighter kind of problem that occasionally comes\nbefore them is that which is known amongst them by the name of \"The\nAmbiguous Photograph.\" Though it is perplexing to the inexperienced, it\nis regarded in the club as quite a trivial thing. Yet it serves to show\nthe close observation of these sharp-witted fellows. The original\nphotograph hangs on the club wall, and has baffled every guest who has\nexamined it. Yet any child should be able to solve the mystery. I will\ngive the reader an opportunity of trying his wits at it.\n\nSome of the members were one evening seated together in their clubhouse\nin the Adelphi. Those present were: Henry Melville, a barrister not\noverburdened with briefs, who was discussing a problem with Ernest\nRussell, a bearded man of middle age, who held some easy post in Somerset\nHouse, and was a Senior Wrangler and one of the most subtle thinkers of\nthe club; Fred Wilson, a journalist of very buoyant spirits, who had more\nreal capacity than one would at first suspect; John Macdonald, a\nScotsman, whose record was that he had never solved a puzzle himself\nsince the club was formed, though frequently he had put others on the\ntrack of a deep solution; Tim Churton, a bank clerk, full of cranky,\nunorthodox ideas as to perpetual motion; also Harold Tomkins, a\nprosperous accountant, remarkably familiar with the elegant branch of\nmathematics--the theory of numbers.\n\nSuddenly Herbert Baynes entered the room, and everybody saw at once from\nhis face that he had something interesting to communicate. Baynes was a\nman of private means, with no occupation.\n\n\"Here's a quaint little poser for you all,\" said Baynes. \"I have received\nit to-day from Dovey.\"\n\nDovey was proprietor of one of the many private detective agencies that\nfound it to their advantage to keep in touch with the club.\n\n\"Is it another of those easy cryptograms?\" asked Wilson. \"If so, I would\nsuggest sending it upstairs to the billiard-marker.\"\n\n\"Don't be sarcastic, Wilson,\" said Melville. \"Remember, we are indebted\nto Dovey for the great Railway Signal Problem that gave us all a week's\namusement in the solving.\"\n\n\"If you fellows want to hear,\" resumed Baynes, \"just try to keep quiet\nwhile I relate the amusing affair to you. You all know of the jealous\nlittle Yankee who married Lord Marksford two years ago? Lady Marksford\nand her husband have been in Paris for two or three months. Well, the\npoor creature soon got under the influence of the green-eyed monster, and\nformed the opinion that Lord Marksford was flirting with other ladies of\nhis acquaintance.\n\n\"Now, she has actually put one of Dovey's spies on to that excellent\nhusband of hers; and the myrmidon has been shadowing him about for a\nfortnight with a pocket camera. A few days ago he came to Lady Marksford\nin great glee. He had snapshotted his lordship while actually walking in\nthe public streets with a lady who was not his wife.\"\n\n\"'What is the use of this at all?' asked the jealous woman.\n\n\"'Well, it is evidence, your ladyship, that your husband was walking with\nthe lady. I know where she is staying, and in a few days shall have found\nout all about her.'\n\n\"'But, you stupid man,' cried her ladyship, in tones of great contempt,\n'how can any one swear that this is his lordship, when the greater part\nof him, including his head and shoulders, is hidden from sight?\nAnd--and'--she scrutinized the photo carefully--'why, I guess it is\nimpossible from this photograph to say whether the gentleman is walking\nwith the lady or going in the opposite direction!'\n\n\"Thereupon she dismissed the detective in high dudgeon. Dovey has himself\njust returned from Paris, and got this account of the incident from her\nladyship. He wants to justify his man, if possible, by showing that the\nphoto does disclose which way the man is going. Here it is. See what you\nfellows can make of it.\"\n\nOur illustration is a faithful drawing made from the original photograph.\nIt will be seen that a slight but sudden summer shower is the real cause\nof the difficulty.\n\nAll agreed that Lady Marksford was right--that it is impossible to\ndetermine whether the man is walking with the lady or not.\n\n\"Her ladyship is wrong,\" said Baynes, after everybody had made a close\nscrutiny. \"I find there is important evidence in the picture. Look at it\ncarefully.\"\n\"Of course,\" said Melville, \"we can tell nothing from the frock-coat. It\nmay be the front or the tails. Blessed if I can say! Then he has his\novercoat over his arm, but which way his arm goes it is impossible to\nsee.\"\n\n\"How about the bend of the legs?\" asked Churton.\n\n\"Bend! why, there isn't any bend,\" put in Wilson, as he glanced over the\nother's shoulder. \"From the picture you might suspect that his lordship\nhas no knees. The fellow took his snapshot just when the legs happened to\nbe perfectly straight.\"\n\"I'm thinking that perhaps----\" began Macdonald, adjusting his\neye-glasses.\n\n\"Don't think, Mac,\" advised Wilson. \"It might hurt you. Besides, it is no\nuse you thinking that if the dog would kindly pass on things would be\neasy. He won't.\"\n\n\"The man's general pose seems to me to imply movement to the left,\"\nTomkins thought.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" Melville declared, \"it appears to me clearly to\nsuggest movement to the right.\"\n\n\"Now, look here, you men,\" said Russell, whose opinions always carried\nrespect in the club. \"It strikes me that what we have to do is to\nconsider the attitude of the lady rather than that of the man. Does her\nattention seem to be directed to somebody by her side?\"\n\nEverybody agreed that it was impossible to say.\n\n\"I've got it!\" shouted Wilson. \"Extraordinary that none of you have seen\nit. It is as clear as possible. It all came to me in a flash!\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked Baynes.\n\n\"Why, it is perfectly obvious. You see which way the dog is going--to the\nleft. Very well. Now, Baynes, to whom does the dog belong?\"\n\n\"To the detective!\"\n\nThe laughter against Wilson that followed this announcement was simply\nboisterous, and so prolonged that Russell, who had at the time possession\nof the photo, seized the opportunity for making a most minute examination\nof it. In a few moments he held up his hands to invoke silence.\n\n\"Baynes is right,\" he said. \"There is important evidence there which\nsettles the matter with certainty. Assuming that the gentleman is really\nLord Marksford--and the figure, so far as it is visible, is his--I have\nno hesitation myself in saying that--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" all the members shouted at once.\n\n\"Don't break the rules of the club, Russell, though Wilson did,\" said\nMelville. \"Recollect that 'no member shall openly disclose his solution\nto a puzzle unless all present consent.'\"\n\n\"You need not have been alarmed,\" explained Russell. \"I was simply going\nto say that I have no hesitation in declaring that Lord Marksford is\nwalking in one particular direction. In which direction I will tell you\nwhen you have all 'given it up.'\"", "answer": "One by one the members of the Club succeeded in discovering the key to\nthe mystery of the Ambiguous Photograph, except Churton, who was at\nlength persuaded to \"give it up.\" Herbert Baynes then pointed out to him\nthat the coat that Lord Marksford was carrying over his arm was a lady's\ncoat, because the buttons are on the left side, whereas a man's coat\nalways has the buttons on the right-hand side. Lord Marksford would not\nbe likely to walk about the streets of Paris with a lady's coat over his\narm unless he was accompanying the owner. He was therefore walking with\nthe lady.\n\nAs they were talking a waiter brought a telegram to Baynes.\n\n\"Here you are,\" he said, after reading the message. \"A wire from Dovey:\n'Don't bother about photo. Find lady was the gentleman's sister, passing\nthrough Paris.' That settles it. You might notice that the lady was\nlightly clad, and therefore the coat might well be hers. But it is clear\nthat the rain was only a sudden shower, and no doubt they were close to\ntheir destination, and she did not think it worth while to put the coat\non.\""}
{"idx": 63, "title": "The Cornish Cliff Mystery", "content": "Though the incident known in the Club as \"The Cornish Cliff Mystery\" has\nnever been published, every one remembers the case with which it was\nconnected--an embezzlement at Todd's Bank in Cornhill a few years ago.\nLamson and Marsh, two of the firm's clerks, suddenly disappeared; and it\nwas found that they had absconded with a very large sum of money. There\nwas an exciting hunt for them by the police, who were so prompt in their\naction that it was impossible for the thieves to get out of the country.\nThey were traced as far as Truro, and were known to be in hiding in\nCornwall.\n\nJust at this time it happened that Henry Melville and Fred Wilson were\naway together on a walking tour round the Cornish coast. Like most\npeople, they were interested in the case; and one morning, while at\nbreakfast at a little inn, they learnt that the absconding men had been\ntracked to that very neighbourhood, and that a strong cordon of police\nhad been drawn round the district, making an escape very improbable. In\nfact, an inspector and a constable came into the inn to make some\ninquiries, and exchanged civilities with the two members of the Puzzle\nClub. A few references to some of the leading London detectives, and the\nproduction of a confidential letter Melville happened to have in his\npocket from one of them, soon established complete confidence, and the\ninspector opened out.\n\nHe said that he had just been to examine a very important clue a quarter\nof a mile from there, and expressed the opinion that Messrs. Lamson and\nMarsh would never again be found alive. At the suggestion of Melville the\nfour men walked along the road together.\n\n\"There is our stile in the distance,\" said the inspector. \"This constable\nfound beside it the pocket-book that I have shown you, containing the\nname of Marsh and some memoranda in his handwriting. It had evidently\nbeen dropped by accident. On looking over the stone stile he noticed the\nfootprints of two men--which I have already proved from particulars\npreviously supplied to the police to be those of the men we want--and I\nam sure you will agree that they point to only one possible conclusion.\"\n\nArrived at the spot, they left the hard road and got over the stile. The\nfootprints of the two men were here very clearly impressed in the thin\nbut soft soil, and they all took care not to trample on the tracks. They\nfollowed the prints closely, and found that they led straight to the edge\nof a cliff forming a sheer precipice, almost perpendicular, at the foot\nof which the sea, some two hundred feet below, was breaking among the\nboulders.\n\"Here, gentlemen, you see,\" said the inspector, \"that the footprints lead\nstraight to the edge of the cliff, where there is a good deal of\ntrampling about, and there end. The soil has nowhere been disturbed for\nyards around, except by the footprints that you see. The conclusion is\nobvious.\"\n\n\"That, knowing they were unable to escape capture, they decided not to be\ntaken alive, and threw themselves over the cliff?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Exactly. Look to the right and the left, and you will find no footprints\nor other marks anywhere. Go round there to the left, and you will be\nsatisfied that the most experienced mountaineer that ever lived could\nnot make a descent, or even anywhere get over the edge of the cliff.\nThere is no ledge or foothold within fifty feet.\"\n\n\"Utterly impossible,\" said Melville, after an inspection. \"What do you\npropose to do?\"\n\n\"I am going straight back to communicate the discovery to headquarters.\nWe shall withdraw the cordon and search the coast for the dead bodies.\"\n\n\"Then you will make a fatal mistake,\" said Melville. \"The men are alive\nand in hiding in the district. Just examine the prints again. Whose is\nthe large foot?\"\n\n\"That is Lamson's, and the small print is Marsh's. Lamson was a tall man,\njust over six feet, and Marsh was a little fellow.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Melville. \"And yet you will find that Lamson\ntakes a shorter stride than Marsh. Notice, also, the peculiarity that\nMarsh walks heavily on his heels, while Lamson treads more on his toes.\nNothing remarkable in that? Perhaps not; but has it occurred to you that\nLamson walked behind Marsh? Because you will find that he sometimes\ntreads over Marsh's footsteps, though you will never find Marsh treading\nin the steps of the other.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that the men walked backwards in their own footprints?\"\nasked the inspector.\n\n\"No; that is impossible. No two men could walk backwards some two hundred\nyards in that way with such exactitude. You will not find a single place\nwhere they have missed the print by even an eighth of an inch. Quite\nimpossible. Nor do I suppose that two men, hunted as they were, could\nhave provided themselves with flying-machines, balloons, or even\nparachutes. They did not drop over the cliff.\"\n\nMelville then explained how the men had got away. His account proved to\nbe quite correct, for it will be remembered that they were caught, hiding\nunder some straw in a barn, within two miles of the spot. How did they\nget away from the edge of the cliff?", "answer": "Melville's explanation of the Cornish Cliff Mystery was very simple when\nhe gave it. Yet it was an ingenious trick that the two criminals adopted,\nand it would have completely succeeded had not our friends from the\nPuzzle Club accidentally appeared on the scene. This is what happened:\nWhen Lamson and Marsh reached the stile, Marsh alone walked to the top of\nthe cliff, with Lamson's larger boots in his hands. Arrived at the edge\nof the cliff, he changed the boots and walked backwards to the stile,\ncarrying his own boots.\n\nThis little manoeuvre accounts for the smaller footprints showing a\ndeeper impression at the heel, and the larger prints a deeper impression\nat the toe; for a man will walk more heavily on his heels when going\nforward, but will make a deeper impression with the toes in walking\nbackwards. It will also account for the fact that the large footprints\nwere sometimes impressed over the smaller ones, but never the reverse;\nalso for the circumstance that the larger footprints showed a shorter\nstride, for a man will necessarily take a smaller stride when walking\nbackwards. The pocket-book was intentionally dropped, to lead the police\nto discover the footprints, and so be put on the wrong scent."}
{"idx": 64, "title": "The Runaway Motor-Car", "content": "The little affair of the \"Runaway Motor-car\" is a good illustration of\nhow a knowledge of some branch of puzzledom may be put to unexpected use.\nA member of the Club, whose name I have at the moment of writing\nforgotten, came in one night and said that a friend of his was bicycling\nin Surrey on the previous day, when a motor-car came from behind, round a\ncorner, at a terrific speed, caught one of his wheels, and sent him\nflying in the road. He was badly knocked about, and fractured his left\narm, while his machine was wrecked. The motor-car was not stopped, and he\nhad been unable to trace it.\n\nThere were two witnesses to the accident, which was beyond question the\nfault of the driver of the car. An old woman, a Mrs. Wadey, saw the whole\nthing, and tried to take the number of the car. She was positive as to\nthe letters, which need not be given, and was certain also that the first\nfigure was a 1. The other figures she failed to read on account of the\nspeed and dust.\n\nThe other witness was the village simpleton, who just escapes being an\narithmetical genius, but is excessively stupid in everything else.\n\nHe is always working out sums in his head; and all he could say was that\nthere were five figures in the number, and that he found that when he\nmultiplied the first two figures by the last three they made the same\nfigures, only in different order--just as 24 multiplied by 651 makes\n15,624 (the same five figures), in which case the number of the car would\nhave been 24,651; and he knew there was no 0 in the number.\n\n\"It will be easy enough to find that car,\" said Russell. \"The known facts\nare possibly sufficient to enable one to discover the exact number. You\nsee, there must be a limit to the five-figure numbers having the\npeculiarity observed by the simpleton. And these are further limited by\nthe fact that, as Mrs. Wadey states, the number began with the figure 1.\nWe have therefore to find these numbers. It may conceivably happen that\nthere is only one such number, in which case the thing is solved. But\neven if there are several cases, the owner of the actual car may easily\nbe found.\n\n\"How will you manage that?\" somebody asked.\n\n\"Surely,\" replied Russell, \"the method is quite obvious. By the process\nof elimination. Every owner except the one in fault will be able to prove\nan alibi. Yet, merely guessing offhand, I think it quite probable that\nthere is only one number that fits the case. We shall see.\"\nRussell was right, for that very night he sent the number by post, with\nthe result that the runaway car was at once traced, and its owner, who\nwas himself driving, had to pay the cost of the damages resulting from\nhis carelessness. What was the number of the car?", "answer": "Russell found that there are just twelve five-figure numbers that have\nthe peculiarity that the first two figures multiplied by the last\nthree--all the figures being different, and there being no 0--will\nproduce a number with exactly the same five figures, in a different\norder. But only one of these twelve begins with a 1--namely, 14926. Now,\nif we multiply 14 by 926, the result is 12964, which contains the same\nfive figures. The number of the motor-car was therefore 14926.\n\nHere are the other eleven numbers:--24651, 42678, 51246, 57834, 75231,\n78624, 87435, 72936, 65281, 65983, and 86251."}
{"idx": 65, "title": "The Mystery of Ravensdene Park", "content": "The mystery of Ravensdene Park, which I will now present, was a tragic\naffair, as it involved the assassination of Mr. Cyril Hastings at his\ncountry house a short distance from London.\n\nOn February 17th, at 11 p.m., there was a heavy fall of snow, and though\nit lasted only half an hour, the ground was covered to a depth of several\ninches. Mr. Hastings had been spending the evening at the house of a\nneighbour, and left at midnight to walk home, taking the short route that\nlay through Ravensdene Park--that is, from D to A in the sketch-plan. But\nin the early morning he was found dead, at the point indicated by the\nstar in our diagram, stabbed to the heart. All the seven gates were\npromptly closed, and the footprints in the snow examined. These were\nfortunately very distinct, and the police obtained the following facts:--\nThe footprints of Mr. Hastings were very clear, straight from D to the\nspot where he was found. There were the footprints of the Ravensdene\nbutler--who retired to bed five minutes before midnight--from E to EE.\nThere were the footprints of the gamekeeper from A to his lodge at AA.\nOther footprints showed that one individual had come in at gate B and\nleft at gate BB, while another had entered by gate C and left at gate CC.\n\nOnly these five persons had entered the park since the fall of snow. Now,\nit was a very foggy night, and some of these pedestrians had consequently\ntaken circuitous routes, but it was particularly noticed that no track\never crossed another track. Of this the police were absolutely certain,\nbut they stupidly omitted to make a sketch of the various routes before\nthe snow had melted and utterly effaced them.\nThe mystery was brought before the members of the Puzzle Club, who at\nonce set themselves the task of solving it. Was it possible to discover\nwho committed the crime? Was it the butler? Or the gamekeeper? Or the man\nwho came in at B and went out at BB? Or the man who went in at C and left\nat CC? They provided themselves with diagrams--sketch-plans, like the one\nwe have reproduced, which simplified the real form of Ravensdene Park\nwithout destroying the necessary conditions of the problem.\n\nOur friends then proceeded to trace out the route of each person, in\naccordance with the positive statements of the police that we have given.\nIt was soon evident that, as no path ever crossed another, some of the\npedestrians must have lost their way considerably in the fog. But when\nthe tracks were recorded in all possible ways, they had no difficulty in\ndeciding on the assassin's route; and as the police luckily knew whose\nfootprints this route represented, an arrest was made that led to the\nman's conviction.\n\nCan our readers discover whether A, B, C, or E committed the deed? Just\ntrace out the route of each of the four persons, and the key to the\nmystery will reveal itself.", "answer": "The diagrams show that there are two different ways in which the routes\nof the various persons involved in the Ravensdene Mystery may be traced,\nwithout any path ever crossing another. It depends whether the butler, E,\nwent to the north or the south of the gamekeeper's cottage, and the\ngamekeeper, A, went to the south or the north of the hall. But it will be\nfound that the only persons who could have approached Mr. Cyril Hastings\nwithout crossing a path were the butler, E, and the man, C. It was,\nhowever, a fact that the butler retired to bed five minutes before\nmidnight, whereas Mr. Hastings did not leave his friend's house until\nmidnight. Therefore the criminal must have been the man who entered the\npark at C."}
{"idx": 66, "title": "The Buried Treasure", "content": "The problem of the Buried Treasure was of quite a different character. A\nyoung fellow named Dawkins, just home from Australia, was introduced to\nthe club by one of the members, in order that he might relate an\nextraordinary stroke of luck that he had experienced \"down under,\" as the\ncircumstances involved the solution of a poser that could not fail to\ninterest all lovers of puzzle problems. After the club dinner, Dawkins\nwas asked to tell his story, which he did, to the following effect:--\n\n\"I have told you, gentlemen, that I was very much down on my luck. I had\ngone out to Australia to try to retrieve my fortunes, but had met with no\nsuccess, and the future was looking very dark. I was, in fact, beginning\nto feel desperate. One hot summer day I happened to be seated in a\nMelbourne wineshop, when two fellows entered, and engaged in\nconversation. They thought I was asleep, but I assure you I was very wide\nawake.\n\n\"'If only I could find the right field,' said one man, 'the treasure\nwould be mine; and as the original owner left no heir, I have as much\nright to it as anybody else.'\n\n\"'How would you proceed?' asked the other.\n\n\"'Well, it is like this: The document that fell into my hands states\nclearly that the field is square, and that the treasure is buried in it\nat a point exactly two furlongs from one corner, three furlongs from the\nnext corner, and four furlongs from the next corner to that. You see, the\nworst of it is that nearly all the fields in the district are square;\nand I doubt whether there are two of exactly the same size. If only I\nknew the size of the field I could soon discover it, and, by taking these\nsimple measurements, quickly secure the treasure.'\n\n\"'But you would not know which corner to start from, nor which direction\nto go to the next corner.'\n\n\"'My dear chap, that only means eight spots at the most to dig over; and\nas the paper says that the treasure is three feet deep, you bet that\nwouldn't take me long.'\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" continued Dawkins, \"I happen to be a bit of a\nmathematician; and hearing the conversation, I saw at once that for a\nspot to be exactly two, three, and four furlongs from successive corners\nof a square, the square must be of a particular area. You can't get such\nmeasurements to meet at one point in any square you choose. They can only\nhappen in a field of one size, and that is just what these men never\nsuspected. I will leave you the puzzle of working out just what that area\nis.\n\n\"Well, when I found the size of the field, I was not long in discovering\nthe field itself, for the man had let out the district in the\nconversation. And I did not need to make the eight digs, for, as luck\nwould have it, the third spot I tried was the right one. The treasure was\na substantial sum, for it has brought me home and enabled me to start in\na business that already shows signs of being a particularly lucrative\none. I often smile when I think of that poor fellow going about for the\nrest of his life saying: 'If only I knew the size of the field!' while he\nhas placed the treasure safe in my own possession. I tried to find the\nman, to make him some compensation anonymously, but without success.\nPerhaps he stood in little need of the money, while it has saved me from\nruin.\"\n\nCould the reader have discovered the required area of the field from\nthose details overheard in the wineshop? It is an elegant little puzzle,\nand furnishes another example of the practical utility, on unexpected\noccasions, of a knowledge of the art of problem-solving.\n\nTHE PROFESSOR'S PUZZLES\n\n\"Why, here is the Professor!\" exclaimed Grigsby. \"We'll make him show us\nsome new puzzles.\"\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and the club was nearly deserted. Only Grigsby,\nHawkhurst, and myself, of all the members, seemed to be detained in town\nover the season of mirth and mince-pies. The man, however, who had just\nentered was a welcome addition to our number. \"The Professor of Puzzles,\"\nas we had nicknamed him, was very popular at the club, and when, as on\nthe present occasion, things got a little slow, his arrival was a\npositive blessing.\n\nHe was a man of middle age, cheery and kind-hearted, but inclined to be\ncynical. He had all his life dabbled in puzzles, problems, and enigmas of\nevery kind, and what the Professor didn't know about these matters was\nadmittedly not worth knowing. His puzzles always had a charm of their\nown, and this was mainly because he was so happy in dishing them up in\npalatable form.\n\n\"You are the man of all others that we were hoping would drop in,\" said\nHawkhurst. \"Have you got anything new?\"\n\n\"I have always something new,\" was the reply, uttered with feigned\nconceit--for the Professor was really a modest man--\"I'm simply glutted\nwith ideas.\"\n\n\"Where do you get all your notions?\" I asked.\n\n\"Everywhere, anywhere, during all my waking moments. Indeed, two or three\nof my best puzzles have come to me in my dreams.\"\n\n\"Then all the good ideas are not used up?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. And all the old puzzles are capable of improvement,\nembellishment, and extension. Take, for example, magic squares. These\nwere constructed in India before the Christian era, and introduced into\nEurope about the fourteenth century, when they were supposed to possess\ncertain magical properties that I am afraid they have since lost. Any\nchild can arrange the numbers one to nine in a square that will add up\nfifteen in eight ways; but you will see it can be developed into quite a\nnew problem if you use coins instead of numbers.\"", "answer": "The field must have contained between 179 and 180 acres--to be more\nexact, 179.37254 acres. Had the measurements been 3, 2, and 4 furlongs\nrespectively from successive corners, then the field would have been\n209.70537 acres in area.\n\nOne method of solving this problem is as follows. Find the area of\ntriangle APB in terms of _x_, the side of the square. Double the\nresult=_xy_. Divide by _x_ and then square, and we have the value of\n_y_^{2} in terms of _x_. Similarly find value of _z_^{2} in terms of _x_;\nthen solve the equation _y_^{2}+_z_^{2}=3^{2}, which will come out in the\nform _x_^{4}-20_x_^{2}=-37. Therefore _x_^{2}=10+(sqrt{63})=17.937254\nsquare furlongs, very nearly, and as there are ten acres in one square\nfurlong, this equals 179.37254 acres. If we take the negative root of the\nequation, we get the area of the field as 20.62746 acres, in which case\nthe treasure would have been buried outside the field, as in Diagram 2.\nBut this solution is excluded by the condition that the treasure was\nburied in the field. The words were, \"The document ... states clearly\nthat the field is square, and that the treasure is buried in it.\"\nTHE PROFESSOR'S PUZZLES"}
{"idx": 67, "title": "The Coinage Puzzle", "content": "He made a rough diagram, and placed a crown and a florin in two of the\ndivisions, as indicated in the illustration.\n\n\"Now,\" he continued, \"place the fewest possible current English coins in\nthe seven empty divisions, so that each of the three columns, three rows,\nand two diagonals shall add up fifteen shillings. Of course, no division\nmay be without at least one coin, and no two divisions may contain the\nsame value.\"\n\n\"But how can the coins affect the question?\" asked Grigsby.\n\n\"That you will find out when you approach the solution.\"\n\n\"I shall do it with numbers first,\" said Hawkhurst, \"and then substitute\ncoins.\"\n\nFive minutes later, however, he exclaimed, \"Hang it all! I can't help\ngetting the 2 in a corner. May the florin be moved from its present\nposition?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then I give it up.\"\n\nBut Grigsby and I decided that we would work at it another time, so the\nProfessor showed Hawkhurst the solution privately, and then went on with\nhis chat.", "answer": "The point of this puzzle turns on the fact that if the magic square were\nto be composed of whole numbers adding up 15 in all ways, the two must be\nplaced in one of the corners. Otherwise fractions must be used, and these\nare supplied in the puzzle by the employment of sixpences and\nhalf-crowns. I give the arrangement requiring the fewest possible current\nEnglish coins--fifteen. It will be seen that the amount in each corner is\na fractional one, the sum required in the total being a whole number of\nshillings."}

It is a hard nut.\"", "answer": "The first of these puzzles is based on a similar principle, though it is\nreally much easier, because the condition that nine of the stamps must\nbe of different values makes their selection a simple matter, though how\nthey are to be placed requires a little thought or trial until one knows\nthe rule respecting putting the fractions in the corners.

Three of the frogs are supposed to jump from their\npresent position to three vacant glasses, so that in their new relative\npositions still no two frogs shall be in a line. What are the jumps\nmade?\"\n\n\"I suppose----\" began Hawkhurst.\n\n\"I know what you are going to ask,\" anticipated the Professor. \"No; the\nfrogs do not exchange positions, but each of the three jumps to a glass\nthat was not previously occupied.\"\n\n\"But surely there must be scores of solutions?\" I said.\n\n\"I shall be very glad if you can find them,\" replied the Professor with a\ndry smile. \"I only know of one--or rather two, counting a reversal, which\noccurs in consequence of the position being symmetrical.\"", "answer": "It is perfectly true, as the Professor said, that there is only one\nsolution (not counting a reversal) to this puzzle. The frogs that jump\nare George in the third horizontal row; Chang, the artful-looking\nbatrachian at the end of the fourth row; and Wilhelmina, the fair\ncreature in the seventh row. George jumps downwards to the second tumbler\nin the seventh row; Chang, who can only leap short distances in\nconsequence of chronic rheumatism, removes somewhat unwillingly to the\nglass just above him--the eighth in the third row; while Wilhelmina, with\nall the sprightliness of her youth and sex, performs the very creditable\nsaltatory feat of leaping to the fourth tumbler in the fourth row. In\ntheir new positions, as shown in the accompanying diagram, it will be\nfound that of the eight frogs no two are in line vertically,\nhorizontally, or diagonally."}

The snail can move\nup, down, and across the board and through the diagonals.

{"idx": 73, "title": "The Game of Kayles", "content": "Nearly all of our most popular games are of very ancient origin, though\nin many cases they have been considerably developed and improved.\nKayles--derived from the French word _quilles_--was a great favourite in\nthe fourteenth century, and was undoubtedly the parent of our modern game\nof ninepins. Kayle-pins were not confined in those days to any particular\nnumber, and they were generally made of a conical shape and set up in a\nstraight row.\n\nAt first they were knocked down by a club that was thrown at them from a\ndistance, which at once suggests the origin of the pastime of \"shying for\ncocoanuts\" that is to-day so popular on Bank Holidays on Hampstead Heath\nand elsewhere. Then the players introduced balls, as an improvement on\nthe club.\n\nIn the illustration we get a picture of some of our fourteenth-century\nancestors playing at kayle-pins in this manner.\n\nNow, I will introduce to my readers a new game of parlour kayle-pins,\nthat can be played across the table without any preparation whatever. You\nsimply place in a straight row thirteen dominoes, chess-pawns,\ndraughtsmen, counters, coins, or beans--anything will do--all close\ntogether, and then remove the second one as shown in the picture.\n\nIt is assumed that the ancient players had become so expert that they\ncould always knock down any single kayle-pin, or any two kayle-pins that\nstood close together. They therefore altered the game, and it was agreed\nthat the player who knocked down the last pin was the winner.\n\nTherefore, in playing our table-game, all you have to do is to knock down\nwith your fingers, or take away, any single kayle-pin or two adjoining\nkayle-pins, playing alternately until one of the two players makes the\nlast capture, and so wins. I think it will be found a fascinating little\ngame, and I will show the secret of winning.\nRemember that the second kayle-pin must be removed before you begin to\nplay, and that if you knock down two at once those two must be close\ntogether, because in the real game the ball could not do more than this.", "answer": "To win at this game you must, sooner or later, leave your opponent an\neven number of similar groups. Then whatever he does in one group you\nrepeat in a similar group. Suppose, for example, that you leave him these\ngroups: o.o.ooo.ooo. Now, if he knocks down a single, you knock down a\nsingle; if he knocks down two in one triplet, you knock down two in the\nother triplet; if he knocks down the central kayle in a triplet, you\nknock down the central one in the other triplet. In this way you must\neventually win. As the game is started with the arrangement\no.ooooooooooo, the first player can always win, but only by knocking down\nthe sixth or tenth kayle (counting the one already fallen as the second),\nand this leaves in either case o.ooo.ooooooo, as the order of the groups\nis of no importance. Whatever the second player now does, this can always\nbe resolved into an even number of equal groups. Let us suppose that he\nknocks down the single one; then we play to leave him oo.ooooooo. Now,\nwhatever he does we can afterwards leave him either ooo.ooo or o.oo.ooo.\nWe know why the former wins, and the latter wins also; because, however\nhe may play, we can always leave him either o.o, or o.o.o.o, or oo.oo, as\nthe case may be. The complete analysis I can now leave for the amusement\nof the reader."}

The following version of the incident is\ntaken from Hayward's _Life of William the Conqueror_, published in\n1613:--\n\n\"Towards the end of his reigne he appointed his two sonnes Robert and\nHenry, with joynt authoritie, governours of Normandie; the one to\nsuppresse either the insolence or levitie of the other. These went\ntogether to visit the French king lying at Constance: where, entertaining\nthe time with varietie of disports, Henry played with Louis, then\nDaulphine of France, at chesse, and did win of him very much.\n\"Hereat Louis beganne to growe warme in words, and was therein little\nrespected by Henry. The great impatience of the one and the small\nforbearance of the other did strike in the end such a heat between them\nthat Louis threw the chessmen at Henry's face.\n\n\"Henry again stroke Louis with the chessboard, drew blood with the blowe,\nand had presently slain him upon the place had he not been stayed by his\nbrother Robert.\n\n\"Hereupon they presently went to horse, and their spurres claimed so good\nhaste as they recovered Pontoise, albeit they were sharply pursued by the\nFrench.\"\n\nNow, tradition--on this point not trustworthy--says that the chessboard\nbroke into the thirteen fragments shown in our illustration. It will be\nseen that there are twelve pieces, all different in shape, each\ncontaining five squares, and one little piece of four squares only.\n\nWe thus have all the sixty-four squares of the chess-board, and the\npuzzle is simply to cut them out and fit them together, so as to make a\nperfect board properly chequered. The pieces may be easily cut out of a\nsheet of \"squared\" paper, and, if mounted on cardboard, they will form a\nsource of perpetual amusement in the home.\n\nIf you succeed in constructing the chessboard, but do not record the\narrangement, you will find it just as puzzling the next time you feel\ndisposed to attack it.\n\nPrince Henry himself, with all his skill and learning, would have found\nit an amusing pastime.", "answer": "The illustration will show how the thirteen pieces can be put together so\nas to construct the perfect board, and the reverse problem of cutting\nthese particular pieces out will be found equally entertaining."}
{"idx": 75, "title": "The Spider and the Fly", "content": "Inside a rectangular room, measuring 30 feet in length and 12 feet in\nwidth and height, a spider is at a point on the middle of one of the end\nwalls, 1 foot from the ceiling, as at A; and a fly is on the opposite\nwall, 1 foot from the floor in the centre, as shown at B. What is the\nshortest distance that the spider must crawl in order to reach the fly,\nwhich remains stationary? Of course the spider never drops or uses its\nweb, but crawls fairly.", "answer": "Though this problem was much discussed in the _Daily Mail_ from 18th\nJanuary to 7th February 1905, when it appeared to create great public\ninterest, it was actually first propounded by me in the _Weekly Dispatch_\nof 14th June 1903.\n\nImagine the room to be a cardboard box. Then the box may be cut in\nvarious different ways, so that the cardboard may be laid flat on the\ntable. I show four of these ways, and indicate in every case the relative\npositions of the spider and the fly, and the straightened course which\nthe spider must take without going off the cardboard.

Of full bottles he had seven large and\nseven small, and of empty bottles five large and five small, as shown in\nthe illustration. How was he to make the required equitable division?\n\nHe divided the bottles into three groups in several ways that at first\nsight seemed to be quite fair, since two small bottles held just the same\nquantity of wine as one large one. But the large bottles themselves, when\nempty, were not worth two small ones.\n\nHence the abbot's order that each man must take away the same number of\nbottles of each size.\n\nFinally, the cellarman had to consult one of the monks who was good at\npuzzles of this kind, and who showed him how the thing was done. Can you\nfind out just how the distribution was made?", "answer": "Brother John gave the first man three large bottles and one small\nbottleful of wine, and one large and three small empty bottles.

One player represents Hendrick and Katrün, and the other\nthe hogs. The first player moves the Dutchman and his wife one square\neach in any direction (but not diagonally), and then the second player\nmoves both pigs one square each (not diagonally); and so on, in turns,\nuntil Hendrick catches one hog and Katrün the other.\n\nThis you will find would be absurdly easy if the hogs moved first, but\nthis is just what Dutch pigs will not do.", "answer": "A very short examination of this puzzle game should convince the reader\nthat Hendrick can never catch the black hog, and that the white hog can\nnever be caught by Katrün.\n\nEach hog merely runs in and out of one of the nearest corners and can\nnever be captured. The fact is, curious as it must at first sight appear,\na Dutchman cannot catch a black hog, and a Dutchwoman can never capture a\nwhite one! But each can, without difficulty, catch one of the other\ncolour.\n\nSo if the first player just determines that he will send Hendrick after\nthe white porker and Katrün after the black one, he will have no\ndifficulty whatever in securing both in a very few moves.\n\nIt is, in fact, so easy that there is no necessity whatever to give the\nline of play. We thus, by means of the game, solve the puzzle in real\nlife, why the Dutchman and his wife could not catch their pigs: in their\nsimplicity and ignorance of the peculiarities of Dutch hogs, each went\nafter the wrong animal.\n\nThe little principle involved in this puzzle is that known to\nchess-players as \"getting the opposition.\" The rule, in the case of my\npuzzle (where the moves resemble rook moves in chess, with the added\ncondition that the rook may only move to an adjoining square), is simply\nthis. Where the number of squares on the same row, between the man or\nwoman and the hog, is odd, the hog can never be captured; where the\nnumber of squares is even, a capture is possible. The number of squares\nbetween Hendrick and the black hog, and between Katrün and the white hog,\nis 1 (an odd number), therefore these individuals cannot catch the\nanimals they are facing. But the number between Hendrick and the white\nhog, and between Katrün and the black one, is 6 (an even number),\ntherefore they may easily capture those behind them."}
{"idx": 79, "title": "The Thirty-one Game", "content": "This is a game that used to be (and may be to this day, for aught I know)\na favourite means of swindling employed by card-sharpers at racecourses\nand in railway carriages.\n\nAs, on its own merits, however, the game is particularly interesting, I\nwill make no apology for presenting it to my readers.\n\nThe cardsharper lays down the twenty-four cards shown in the\nillustration, and invites the innocent wayfarer to try his luck or skill\nby seeing which of them can first score thirty-one, or drive his opponent\nbeyond, in the following manner:--\n\nOne player turns down a card, say a 2, and counts \"two\"; the second\nplayer turns down a card, say a 5, and, adding this to the score, counts\n\"seven\"; the first player turns down another card, say a 1, and counts\n\"eight\"; and so the play proceeds alternately until one of them scores\nthe \"thirty-one,\" and so wins.\n\nNow, the question is, in order to win, should you turn down the first\ncard, or courteously request your opponent to do so? And how should you\nconduct your play? The reader will perhaps say: \"Oh, that is easy enough.\nYou must play first, and turn down a 3; then, whatever your opponent\ndoes, he cannot stop your making ten, or stop your making seventeen,\ntwenty-four, and the winning thirty-one. You have only to secure these\nnumbers to win.\"\n\nBut this is just that little knowledge which is such a dangerous thing,\nand it places you in the hands of the sharper.\n\nYou play 3, and the sharper plays 4 and counts \"seven\"; you play 3 and\ncount \"ten\"; the sharper turns down 3 and scores \"thirteen\"; you play 4\nand count \"seventeen\"; the sharper plays a 4 and counts \"twenty-one\"; you\nplay 3 and make your \"twenty-four.\"\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  [1]  [1]  [1]  [1]\n\n  [2]  [2]  [2]  [2]\n\n  [3]  [3]  [3]  [3]\n\n  [4]  [4]  [4]  [4]\n\n  [5]  [5]  [5]  [5]\n\n  [6]  [6]  [6]  [6]   ]\n\nNow the sharper plays the last 4 and scores \"twenty-eight.\" You look in\nvain for another 3 with which to win, for they are all turned down!

If after your lead of 5 he plays anything\nbut another 5, you make 10 or 17 and win. The first player may also win\nby leading a 1 or a 2, but the play is complicated.

Take your pencil and trace out the route\nfor the line A to A, B to B, C to C, and so on, without ever allowing one\nline to cross another or pass through another company's station.", "answer": "This puzzle was artfully devised by the yellow man. It is not a matter\nfor wonder that the representatives of the five countries interested were\nbewildered. It would have puzzled the engineers a good deal to construct\nthose circuitous routes so that the various trains might run with safety.\nDiagram 1 shows directions for the five systems of lines, so that no line\nshall ever cross another, and this appears to be the method that would\nrequire the shortest possible mileage.\nThe reader may wish to know how many different solutions there are to the\npuzzle. To this I should answer that the number is indeterminate, and I\nwill explain why. If we simply consider the case of line A alone, then\none route would be Diagram 2, another 3, another 4, and another 5. If 3\nis different from 2, as it undoubtedly is, then we must regard 5 as\ndifferent from 4. But a glance at the four diagrams, 2, 3, 4, 5, in\nsuccession will show that we may continue this \"winding up\" process for\never; and as there will always be an unobstructed way (however long and\ncircuitous) from stations B and E to their respective main lines, it is\nevident that the number of routes for line A alone is infinite. Therefore\nthe number of complete solutions must also be infinite, if railway lines,\nlike other lines, have no breadth; and indeterminate, unless we are told\nthe greatest number of parallel lines that it is possible to construct in\ncertain places. If some clear condition, restricting these \"windings up,\"\nwere given, there would be no great difficulty in giving the number of\nsolutions. With any reasonable limitation of the kind, the number would,\nI calculate, be little short of two thousand, surprising though it may\nappear."}
{"idx": 81, "title": "The Eight Clowns", "content": "This illustration represents a troupe of clowns I once saw on the\nContinent. Each clown bore one of the numbers 1 to 9 on his body. After\ngoing through the usual tumbling, juggling, and other antics, they\ngenerally concluded with a few curious little numerical tricks, one of\nwhich was the rapid formation of a number of magic squares. It occurred\nto me that if clown No. 1 failed to appear (as happens in the\nillustration), this last item of their performance might not be so easy.\nThe reader is asked to discover how these eight clowns may arrange\nthemselves in the form of a square (one place being vacant), so that\nevery one of the three columns, three rows, and each of the two diagonals\nshall add up the same. The vacant place may be at any part of the square,\nbut it is No. 1 that must be absent.", "answer": "This is a little novelty in magic squares. These squares may be formed\nwith numbers that are in arithmetical progression, or that are not in\nsuch progression. If a square be formed of the former class, one place\nmay be left vacant, but only under particular conditions. In the case of\nour puzzle there would be no difficulty in making the magic square with 9\nmissing; but with 1 missing (that is, using 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9)\nit is not possible. But a glance at the original illustration will show\nthat the numbers we have to deal with are not actually those just\nmentioned. The clown that has a 9 on his body is portrayed just at the\nmoment when two balls which he is juggling are in mid-air. The positions\nof these balls clearly convert his figure into the recurring decimal\n.[.9]. Now, since the recurring decimal .[.9] is equal to 9/9, and\ntherefore to 1, it is evident that, although the clown who bears the\nfigure 1 is absent, the man who bears the figure 9 by this simple\nartifice has for the occasion given his _figure_ the value of the\n_number_ 1.

The\ninterview had to do with an affair of the heart; but after the man of\nmagic had foretold the most favourable issues, and concocted a\nlove-potion that was certain to help his visitor's cause, the\nconversation drifted on to occult subjects generally.\n\"And art thou learned also in the magic of numbers?\" asked the knight.\n\"Show me but one sample of thy wit in these matters.\"\n\nThe old wizard took five blocks bearing numbers, and placed them on a\nshelf, apparently at random, so that they stood in the order 41096, as\nshown in our illustration. He then took in his hands an 8 and a 3, and\nheld them together to form the number 83.\n\n\"Sir Knight, tell me,\" said the wizard, \"canst thou multiply one number\ninto the other in thy mind?\"\n\n\"Nay, of a truth,\" the good knight replied. \"I should need to set out\nupon the task with pen and scrip.\"\n\n\"Yet mark ye how right easy a thing it is to a man learned in the lore of\nfar Araby, who knoweth all the magic that is hid in the philosophy of\nnumbers!\"\n\nThe wizard simply placed the 3 next to the 4 on the shelf, and the 8 at\nthe other end. It will be found that this gives the answer quite\ncorrectly--3410968. Very curious, is it not? How many other two-figure\nmultipliers can you find that will produce the same effect? You may place\njust as many blocks as you like on the shelf, bearing any figures you\nchoose.", "answer": "This puzzle is both easy and difficult, for it is a very simple matter to\nfind one of the multipliers, which is 86. If we multiply 8 by 86, all we\nneed do is to place the 6 in front and the 8 behind in order to get the\ncorrect answer, 688. But the second number is not to be found by mere\ntrial. It is 71, and the number to be multiplied is no less than\n1639344262295081967213114754098360655737704918032787. If you want to\nmultiply this by 71, all you have to do is to place another 1 at the\nbeginning and another 7 at the end--a considerable saving of labour!\nThese two, and the example shown by the wizard, are the only two-figure\nmultipliers, but the number to be multiplied may always be increased.\nThus, if you prefix to 41096 the number 41095890, repeated any number of\ntimes, the result may always be multiplied by 83 in the wizard's peculiar\nmanner.\n\nIf we add the figures of any number together and then, if necessary,\nagain add, we at last get a single-figure number. This I call the\n\"digital root.\" Thus, the digital root of 521 is 8, and of 697 it is 4.\nThis digital analysis is extensively dealt with in _A. in M._ Now, it is\nevident that the digital roots of the two numbers required by the puzzle\nmust produce the same root in sum and product. This can only happen when\nthe roots of the two numbers are 2 and 2, or 9 and 9, or 3 and 6, or 5\nand 8. Therefore the two-figure multiplier must have a digital root of 2,\n3, 5, 6, 8, or 9. There are ten such numbers in each case. I write out\nall the sixty, then I strike out all those numbers where the second\nfigure is higher than the first, and where the two figures are alike\n(thirty-six numbers in all); also all remaining numbers where the first\nfigure is odd and the second figure even (seven numbers); also all\nmultiples of 5 (three more numbers). The numbers 21 and 62 I reject on\ninspection, for reasons that I will not enter into. I then have left, out\nof the original sixty, only the following twelve numbers: 83, 63, 81, 84,\n93, 42, 51, 87, 41, 86, 53, and 71. These are the only possible\nmultipliers that I have really to examine.\n\nMy process is now as curious as it is simple in working. First trying 83,\nI deduct 10 and call it 73. Adding 0's to the second figure, I say if\n30000, etc., ever has a remainder 43 when divided by 73, the dividend\nwill be the required multiplier for 83. I get the 43 in this way. The\nonly multiplier of 3 that produces an 8 in the digits place is 6. I\ntherefore multiply 73 by 6 and get 438, or 43 after rejecting the 8. Now,\n300,000 divided by 73 leaves the remainder 43, and the dividend is 4,109.\nTo this 1 add the 6 mentioned above and get 41,096 x 83, the example\ngiven on page 129.\n\nIn trying the even numbers there are two cases to be considered. Thus,\ntaking 86, we may say that if 60000, etc., when divided by 76 leaves\neither 22 or 60 (because 3×6 and 8×6 both produce 8), we get a solution.\nBut I reject the former on inspection, and see that 60 divided by 76 is\n0, leaving a remainder 60. Therefore 8 x 86 = 688, the other example. It\nwill be found in the case of 71 that 100000, etc., divided by 61 gives a\nremainder 42, (7 × 61 = 427) after producing the long dividend at the\nbeginning of this article, with the 7 added.\n\nThe other multipliers fail to produce a solution, so 83, 86, and 71 are\nthe only three possible multipliers. Those who are familiar with the\nprinciple of recurring decimals (as somewhat explained in my next note on\nNo. 83, \"The Ribbon Problem\") will understand the conditions under which\nthe remainders repeat themselves after certain periods, and will only\nfind it necessary in two or three cases to make any lengthy divisions. It\nclearly follows that there is an unlimited number of multiplicands for\neach multiplier."}
{"idx": 83, "title": "The Ribbon Problem", "content": "If we take the ribbon by the ends and pull it out straight, we have the\nnumber 0588235294117647. This number has the peculiarity that, if we\nmultiply it by any one of the numbers, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, we get\nexactly the same number in the circle, starting from a different place.\nFor example, multiply by 4, and the product is 2352941176470588, which\nstarts from the dart in the circle. So, if we multiply by 3, we get the\nsame result starting from the star. Now, the puzzle is to place a\ndifferent arrangement of figures on the ribbon that will produce similar\nresults when so multiplied; only the 0 and the 7 appearing at the ends of\nthe ribbon must not be removed.", "answer": "The solution is as follows: Place this rather lengthy number on the\nribbon, 0212765957446808510638297872340425531914393617. It may be\nmultiplied by any number up to 46 inclusive to give the same order of\nfigures in the ring. The number previously given can be multiplied by any\nnumber up to 16. I made the limit 9 in order to put readers off the\nscent. The fact is these two numbers are simply the recurring decimals\nthat equal 1/17 and 1/47 respectively. Multiply the one by seventeen and\nthe other by forty-seven, and you will get all nines in each case.\n\nIn transforming a vulgar fraction, say 1/17, to a decimal fraction, we\nproceed as below, adding as many noughts to the dividend as we like until\nthere is no remainder, or until we get a recurring series of figures, or\nuntil we have carried it as far as we require, since every additional\nfigure in a never-ending decimal carries us nearer and nearer to\nexactitude.\n\n  17) 100 (.058823\n       85\n     ----\n       150\n       136\n      ----\n        140\n        136\n       ----\n          40\n          34\n        ----\n           60\n           51\n         ----\n            9\n\nNow, since all powers of 10 can only contain factors of the powers of 2\nand 5, it clearly follows that your decimal never will come to an end if\nany other factor than these occurs in the denominator of your vulgar\nfraction. Thus, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 give us the exact decimals, .5, .25,\nand .125; 1/5 and 1/25 give us .2 and .04; 1/10 and 1/20 give us .1 and\n.05: because the denominators are all composed of 2 and 5 factors. But if\nyou wish to convert 1/3, 1/6, or 1/7, your division sum will never end,\nbut you will get these decimals, .33333, etc., .166666, etc., and\n.142857142857142857, etc., where, in the first case, the 3 keeps on\nrepeating for ever and ever; in the second case the 6 is the repeater,\nand in the last case we get the recurring period of 142857. In the case\nof 1/17 (in \"The Ribbon Problem\") we find the circulating period to be\n.0588235294117647.\n\nNow, in the division sum above, the successive remainders are 1, 10, 15,\n14, 4, 6, 9, etc., and these numbers I have inserted around the inner\nring of the diagram. It will be seen that every number from 1 to 16\noccurs once, and that if we multiply our ribbon number by any one of the\nnumbers in the inner ring its position indicates exactly the point at\nwhich the product will begin. Thus, if we multiply by 4, the product will\nbe 235, etc.; if we multiply by 6, 352, etc. We can therefore multiply by\nany number from 1 to 16 and get the desired result.\nThe kernel of the puzzle is this: Any prime number, with the exception of\n2 and 5, which are the factors of 10, will exactly divide without\nremainder a number consisting of as many nines as the number itself, less\none. Thus 999999 (six 9's) is divisible by 7, sixteen 9's are divisible\nby 17, eighteen 9's by 19, and so on. This is always the case, though\nfrequently fewer 9's will suffice; for one 9 is divisible by 3, two by\n11, six by 13, when our ribbon rule for consecutive multipliers breaks\ndown and another law comes in. Therefore, since the 0 and 7 at the ends\nof the ribbon may not be removed, we must seek a fraction with a prime\ndenominator ending in 7 that gives a full period circulator. We try 37,\nand find that it gives a short period decimal, .027, because 37 exactly\ndivides 999; it, therefore, will not do. We next examine 47, and find\nthat it gives us the full period circulator, in 46 figures, at the\nbeginning of this article.\n\nIf you cut any of these full period circulators in half and place one\nhalf under the other, you will find that they will add up all 9's; so you\nneed only work out one half and then write down the complements. Thus, in\nthe ribbon above, if you add 05882352 to 94117647 the result is 99999999,\nand so with our long solution number. Note also in the diagram above that\nnot only are the opposite numbers on the outer ring complementary, always\nmaking 9 when added, but that opposite numbers in the inner ring, our\nremainders, are also complementary, adding to 17 in every case. I ought\nperhaps to point out that in limiting our multipliers to the first nine\nnumbers it seems just possible that a short period circulator might give\na solution in fewer figures, but there are reasons for thinking it\nimprobable."}
{"idx": 84, "title": "The Japanese Ladies and the Carpet", "content": "Three Japanese ladies possessed a square ancestral carpet of considerable\nintrinsic value, but treasured also as an interesting heirloom in the\nfamily. They decided to cut it up and make three square rugs of it, so\nthat each should possess a share in her own house.\n\nOne lady suggested that the simplest way would be for her to take a\nsmaller share than the other two, because then the carpet need not be cut\ninto more than four pieces.\n\nThere are three easy ways of doing this, which I will leave the reader\nfor the present the amusement of finding for himself, merely saying that\nif you suppose the carpet to be nine square feet, then one lady may take\na piece two feet square whole, another a two feet square in two pieces,\nand the third a square foot whole.\n\nBut this generous offer would not for a moment be entertained by the\nother two sisters, who insisted that the square carpet should be so cut\nthat each should get a square mat of exactly the same size.\n\nNow, according to the best Western authorities, they would have found it\nnecessary to cut the carpet into seven pieces; but a correspondent in\nTokio assures me that the legend is that they did it in as few as six\npieces, and he wants to know whether such a thing is possible.\n\nYes; it can be done.\n\nCan you cut out the six pieces that will form three square mats of equal\nsize?", "answer": "If the squares had not to be all the same size, the carpet could be cut\nin four pieces in any one of the three manners shown. In each case the\ntwo pieces marked A will fit together and form one of the three squares,\nthe other two squares being entire. But in order to have the squares\nexactly equal in size, we shall require six pieces, as shown in the\nlarger diagram. No. 1 is a complete square, pieces 4 and 5 will form a\nsecond square, and pieces 2, 3, and 6 will form the third--all of exactly\nthe same size.\n\nIf with the three equal squares we form the rectangle IDBA, then the mean\nproportional of the two sides of the rectangle will be the side of a\nsquare of equal area. Produce AB to C, making BC equal to BD. Then place\nthe point of the compasses at E (midway between A and C) and describe the\narc AC. I am showing the quite general method for converting rectangles\nto squares, but in this particular case we may, of course, at once place\nour compasses at E, which requires no finding. Produce the line BD,\ncutting the arc in F, and BF will be the required side of the square. Now\nmark off AG and DH, each equal to BF, and make the cut IG, and also the\ncut HK from H, perpendicular to ID.

He claims that during a recent\nexpedition in Arctic regions he actually reached the North Pole, but\ncannot induce anybody to believe him. Of course, the difficulty in such\ncases is to produce proof, but he avers that future travellers, when they\nsucceed in accomplishing the same feat, will find evidence on the spot.\nHe says that when he got there he saw a bear going round and round the\ntop of the pole (which he declares _is_ a pole), evidently perplexed by\nthe peculiar fact that no matter in what direction he looked it was\nalways due south. Captain Longbow put an end to the bear's meditations by\nshooting him, and afterwards impaling him, in the manner shown in the\nillustration, as the evidence for future travellers to which I have\nalluded.\nWhen the Captain got one hundred miles south on his return journey he had\na little experience that is somewhat puzzling.

Can you discover how\nthey were arranged?", "answer": "It might have struck the reader that the story of the bear impaled on the\nNorth Pole had no connection with the problem that followed. As a matter\nof fact it is essential to a solution. Eleven bears cannot possibly be\narranged to form of themselves seven rows of bears with four bears in\nevery row. But it is a different matter when Captain Longbow informs us\nthat \"they had so placed themselves that _there were_\" seven rows of four\nbears. For if they were grouped as shown in the diagram, so that three of\nthe bears, as indicated, were in line with the North Pole, that impaled\nanimal would complete the seventh row of four, which cannot be obtained\nin any other way. It obviously does not affect the problem whether this\nseventh row is a hundred miles long or a hundred feet, so long as they\nwere really in a straight line--a point that might perhaps be settled by\nthe captain's pocket compass."}

I will leave my readers to discover for themselves\nhow the figures are to be arrived at."}
{"idx": 92, "title": "The Four Porkers", "content": "The four pigs are so placed, each in a separate sty, that although every\none of the thirty-six sties is in a straight line (either horizontally,\nvertically, or diagonally), with at least one of the pigs, yet no pig is\nin line with another. In how many different ways may the four pigs be\nplaced to fulfil these conditions? If you turn this page round you get\nthree more arrangements, and if you turn it round in front of a mirror\nyou get four more. These are not to be counted as different arrangements.", "answer": "The number of ways in which the four pigs may be placed in the thirty-six\nsties in accordance with the conditions is seventeen, including the\nexample that I gave, not counting the reversals and reflections of these\narrangements as different. Jaenisch, in his _Analyse Mathématique au jeu\ndes Échecs_ (1862), quotes the statement that there are just twenty-one\nsolutions to the little problem on which this puzzle is based. As I had\nmyself only recorded seventeen, I examined the matter again, and found\nthat he was in error, and, doubtless, had mistaken reversals for\ndifferent arrangements.\n\nHere are the seventeen answers. The figures indicate the rows, and their\npositions show the columns. Thus, 104603 means that we place a pig in the\nfirst row of the _first_ column, in no row of the _second_ column, in the\nfourth row of the _third_ column, in the sixth row of the _fourth_\ncolumn, in no row of the _fifth_ column, and in the third row of the\n_sixth_ column. The arrangement E is that which I gave in diagram form:--\n\n  A. 104603\n  B. 136002\n  C. 140502\n  D. 140520\n  E. 160025\n  F. 160304\n  G. 201405\n  H. 201605\n  I. 205104\n  J. 206104\n  K. 241005\n  L. 250014\n  M. 250630\n  N. 260015\n  O. 261005\n  P. 261040\n  Q. 306104\n\nIt will be found that forms N and Q are semi-symmetrical with regard to\nthe centre, and therefore give only two arrangements each by reversal and\nreflection; that form H is quarter-symmetrical, and gives only four\narrangements; while all the fourteen others yield by reversal and\nreflection eight arrangements each. Therefore the pigs may be placed in\n(2 × 2) + (4 × 1) + (8 × 14) = 120 different ways by reversing and\nreflecting all the seventeen forms.\n\nThree pigs alone may be placed so that every sty is in line with a pig,\nprovided that the pigs are not forbidden to be in line with one another;\nbut there is only one way of doing it (if we do not count reversals as\ndifferent), as follows: 105030."}
{"idx": 93, "title": "The Number Blocks", "content": "The children in the illustration have found that a large number of very\ninteresting and instructive puzzles may be made out of number blocks;\nthat is, blocks bearing the ten digits or Arabic figures--1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n6, 7, 8, 9, and 0. The particular puzzle that they have been amusing\nthemselves with is to divide the blocks into two groups of five, and then\nso arrange them in the form of two multiplication sums that one product\nshall be the same as the other. The number of possible solutions is very\nconsiderable, but they have hit on that arrangement that gives the\nsmallest possible product. Thus, 3,485 multiplied by 2 is 6,970, and\n6,970 multiplied by 1 is the same. You will find it quite impossible to\nget any smaller result.\nNow, my puzzle is to find the largest possible result. Divide the blocks\ninto any two groups of five that you like, and arrange them to form two\nmultiplication sums that shall produce the same product and the largest\namount possible. That is all, and yet it is a nut that requires some\ncracking. Of course, fractions are not allowed, nor any tricks whatever.\nThe puzzle is quite interesting enough in the simple form in which I have\ngiven it. Perhaps it should be added that the multipliers may contain two\nfigures.", "answer": "Arrange the blocks so as to form the two multiplication sums 915 × 64 and\n732 × 80, and the product in both cases will be the same: 58,560."}
{"idx": 94, "title": "Foxes and Geese", "content": "Here is a little puzzle of the moving counters class that my readers will\nprobably find entertaining. Make a diagram of any convenient size similar\nto that shown in our illustration, and provide six counters--three marked\nto represent foxes and three to represent geese. Place the geese on the\ndiscs 1, 2, and 3, and the foxes on the discs numbered 10, 11, and 12.\n\nNow the puzzle is this. By moving one at a time, fox and goose\nalternately, along a straight line from one disc to the next one, try to\nget the foxes on 1, 2, and 3, and the geese on 10, 11, and 12--that is,\nmake them exchange places--in the fewest possible moves.\nBut you must be careful never to let a fox and goose get within reach of\neach other, or there will be trouble. This rule, you will find, prevents\nyou moving the fox from 11 on the first move, as on either 4 or 6 he\nwould be within reach of a goose. It also prevents your moving a fox from\n10 to 9, or from 12 to 7. If you play 10 to 5, then your next move may be\n2 to 9 with a goose, which you could not have played if the fox had not\npreviously gone from 10. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that only one\nfox or one goose can be on a disc at the same time. Now, what is the\nsmallest number of moves necessary to make the foxes and geese change\nplaces?", "answer": "The smallest possible number of moves is twenty-two--that is, eleven for\nthe foxes and eleven for the geese. Here is one way of solving the\npuzzle:\n\n  10--5    11--6   12--7   5--12   6--1   7--6\n  ----     ----    ----    ----    ----   ----\n  1--8     2--9    3--4    8--3    9--10  4--9\n\n  12--7    1--8    6--1    7--2    8--3\n  ----     ----    ----    ----    ----\n  3--4     10--5   9--10   4--11   5--12\n\nOf course, the reader will play the first move in the top line, then the\nfirst move in the second line, then the second move in the top line, and\nso on alternately.\nIn _A. in M._, p. 230, I have explained fully my \"buttons and string\"\nmethod of solving puzzles on chequered boards. In Diagram A is shown the\npuzzle in the form in which it may be presented on a portion of the\nchessboard with six knights. A comparison with the illustration on page\n141 will show that I have there dispensed with the necessity of\nexplaining the knight's move to the uninstructed reader by lines that\nindicate those moves. The two puzzles are the same thing in different\ndress. Now compare page 141 with Diagram B, and it will be seen that by\ndisentangling the strings I have obtained a simplified diagram without\naltering the essential relations between the buttons or discs. The reader\nwill now satisfy himself without any difficulty that the puzzle requires\neleven moves for the foxes and eleven for the geese. He will see that a\ngoose on 1 or 3 must go to 8, to avoid being one move from a fox and to\nenable the fox on 11 to come on to the ring. If we play 1--8, then it is\nclearly best to play 10--5 and not 12--5 for the foxes. When they are all\non the circle, then they simply promenade round it in a clockwise\ndirection, taking care to reserve 8--3 and 5--12 for the final moves. It\nis thus rendered ridiculously easy by this method."}
{"idx": 95, "title": "Robinson Crusoe's Table", "content": "Here is a curious extract from Robinson Crusoe's diary. It is not to be\nfound in the modern editions of the Adventures, and is omitted in the\nold. This has always seemed to me to be a pity.\n\n\"The third day in the morning, the wind having abated during the night, I\nwent down to the shore hoping to find a typewriter and other useful\nthings washed up from the wreck of the ship; but all that fell in my way\nwas a piece of timber with many holes in it. My man Friday had many times\nsaid that we stood sadly in need of a square table for our afternoon tea,\nand I bethought me how this piece of wood might be used for that purpose.\nAnd since during the long time that Friday had now been with me I was not\nwanting to lay a foundation of useful knowledge in his mind, I told him\nthat it was my wish to make the table from the timber I had found,\nwithout there being any holes in the top thereof.\n\"Friday was sadly put to it to say how this might be, more especially as\nI said it should consist of no more than two pieces joined together; but\nI taught him how it could be done in such a way that the table might be\nas large as was possible, though, to be sure, I was amused when he said,\n'My nation do much better: they stop up holes, so pieces sugars not fall\nthrough.'\"\n\nNow, the illustration gives the exact proportion of the piece of wood\nwith the positions of the fifteen holes. How did Robinson Crusoe make the\nlargest possible square table-top in two pieces, so that it should not\nhave any holes in it?", "answer": "The diagram shows how the piece of wood should be cut in two pieces to\nform the square table-top. A, B, C, D are the corners of the table. The\nway in which the piece E fits into the piece F will be obvious to the eye\nof the reader. The shaded part is the wood that is discarded."}
{"idx": 96, "title": "The Fifteen Orchards", "content": "In the county of Devon, where the cider comes from, fifteen of the\ninhabitants of a village are imbued with an excellent spirit of friendly\nrivalry, and a few years ago they decided to settle by actual experiment\na little difference of opinion as to the cultivation of apple trees. Some\nsaid they want plenty of light and air, while others stoutly maintained\nthat they ought to be planted pretty closely, in order that they might\nget shade and protection from cold winds. So they agreed to plant a lot\nof young trees, a different number in each orchard, in order to compare\nresults.\n\nOne man had a single tree in his field, another had two trees, another\nhad three trees, another had four trees, another five, and so on, the\nlast man having as many as fifteen trees in his little orchard. Last year\na very curious result was found to have come about. Each of the fifteen\nindividuals discovered that every tree in his own orchard bore exactly\nthe same number of apples. But, what was stranger still, on comparing\nnotes they found that the total gathered in every allotment was almost\nthe same. In fact, if the man with eleven trees had given one apple to\nthe man who had seven trees, and the man with fourteen trees had given\nthree each to the men with nine and thirteen trees, they would all have\nhad exactly the same.\n\nNow, the puzzle is to discover how many apples each would have had (the\nsame in every case) if that little distribution had been carried out. It\nis quite easy if you set to work in the right way.", "answer": "The number must be the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, etc., up to 15,\nthat, when divided by 7, leaves the remainder 1, by 9 leaves 3, by 11\nleaves 10, by 13 leaves 3, and by 14 leaves 8. Such a number is 120. The\nnext number is 360,480, but as we have no record of a tree--especially a\nvery young one--bearing anything like such a large number of apples, we\nmay take 120 to be the only answer that is acceptable."}
{"idx": 97, "title": "The Perplexed Plumber", "content": "When I paid a visit to Peckham recently I found everybody asking, \"What\nhas happened to Sam Solders, the plumber?\" He seemed to be in a bad way,\nand his wife was seriously anxious about the state of his mind. As he had\nfitted up a hot-water apparatus for me some years ago which did not lead\nto an explosion for at least three months (and then only damaged the\ncomplexion of one of the cook's followers), I had considerable regard for\nhim.\n\n\"There he is,\" said Mrs. Solders, when I called to inquire. \"That's how\nhe's been for three weeks. He hardly eats anything, and takes no rest,\nwhilst his business is so neglected that I don't know what is going to\nhappen to me and the five children. All day long--and night too--there he\nis, figuring and figuring, and tearing his hair like a mad thing. It's\nworrying me into an early grave.\"\n\nI persuaded Mrs. Solders to explain matters to me. It seems that he had\nreceived an order from a customer to make two rectangular zinc cisterns,\none with a top and the other without a top. Each was to hold exactly\n1,000 cubic feet of water when filled to the brim. The price was to be a\ncertain amount per cistern, including cost of labour. Now Mr. Solders is\na thrifty man, so he naturally desired to make the two cisterns of such\ndimensions that the smallest possible quantity of metal should be\nrequired. This was the little question that was so worrying him.\nCan my ingenious readers find the dimensions of the most economical\ncistern with a top, and also the exact proportions of such a cistern\nwithout a top, each to hold 1,000 cubic feet of water? By \"economical\" is\nmeant the method that requires the smallest possible quantity of metal.\nNo margin need be allowed for what ladies would call \"turnings.\" I shall\nshow how I helped Mr. Solders out of his dilemma. He says: \"That little\nwrinkle you gave me would be useful to others in my trade.\"", "answer": "The rectangular closed cistern that shall hold a given quantity of water\nand yet have the smallest possible surface of metal must be a perfect\ncube--that is, a cistern every side of which is a square. For 1,000 cubic\nfeet of water the internal dimensions will be 10 ft. × 10 ft. × 10 ft.,\nand the zinc required will be 600 square feet. In the case of a cistern\nwithout a top the proportions will be exactly half a cube. These are the\n\"exact proportions\" asked for in the second case. The exact dimensions\ncannot be given, but 12.6 ft. × 12.6 ft. × 6.3 ft. is a close\napproximation. The cistern will hold a little too much water, at which\nthe buyer will not complain, and it will involve the plumber in a\ntrifling loss not worth considering."}

The height of the shaft of the Nelson column being 200\nfeet and its circumference 16 feet 8 inches, it is wreathed in a spiral\ngarland which passes round it exactly five times. What is the length of\nthe garland? It looks rather difficult, but is really remarkably easy.\"\n\nHe was right. The puzzle is quite easy if properly attacked. Of course\nthe height and circumference are not correct, but chosen for the purposes\nof the puzzle. The artist has also intentionally drawn the cylindrical\nshaft of the column of equal circumference throughout. If it were\ntapering, the puzzle would be less easy.", "answer": "If you take a sheet of paper and mark it with a diagonal line, as in\nFigure A, you will find that when you roll it into cylindrical form, with\nthe line outside, it will appear as in Figure B.\nIt will be seen that the spiral (in one complete turn) is merely the\nhypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which the length and width of\nthe paper are the other two sides. In the puzzle given, the lengths of\nthe two sides of the triangle are 40 ft. (one-fifth of 200 ft.) and 16\nft. 8 in. Therefore the hypotenuse is 43 ft. 4 in. The length of the\ngarland is therefore five times as long--216 ft. 8 in.

Consequently, if twelve could do the work in\nfour and a half months, six ladies would do it in twice the time--four\nand a half months longer--which is the correct answer.\n\nAt first sight there might appear to be some ambiguity about the words,\n\"Everybody kissed everybody else, except, of course, the bashful young\nman himself.\" Might this not be held to imply that all the ladies\nimmodestly kissed the curate, although they were not (except the sisters)\nkissed by him in return? No; because, in that case, it would be found\nthat there must have been twelve girls, not one of whom was a sister,\nwhich is contrary to the conditions. If, again, it should be held that\nthe sisters might not, according to the wording, have kissed their\nbrother, although he kissed them, I reply that in that case there must\nhave been twelve girls, all of whom must have been his sisters. And the\nreference to the ladies who might have worked exclusively of the sisters\nshuts out the possibility of this."}
{"idx": 106, "title": "The Adventurous Snail", "content": "A simple version of the puzzle of the climbing snail is familiar to\neverybody. We were all taught it in the nursery, and it was apparently\nintended to inculcate the simple moral that we should never slip if we\ncan help it. This is the popular story. A snail crawls up a pole 12 feet\nhigh, ascending 3 feet every day and slipping back 2 feet every night.\nHow long does it take to get to the top? Of course, we are expected to\nsay the answer is twelve days, because the creature makes an actual\nadvance of 1 foot in every twenty-four hours. But the modern infant in\narms is not taken in in this way. He says, correctly enough, that at the\nend of the ninth day the snail is 3 feet from the top, and therefore\nreaches the summit of its ambition on the tenth day, for it would cease\nto slip when it had got to the top.\n\nLet us, however, consider the original story. Once upon a time two\nphilosophers were walking in their garden, when one of them espied a\nhighly respectable member of the Helix Aspersa family, a pioneer in\nmountaineering, in the act of making the perilous ascent of a wall 20\nfeet high. Judging by the trail, the gentleman calculated that the snail\nascended 3 feet each day, sleeping and slipping back 2 feet every night.\n\n\"Pray tell me,\" said the philosopher to his friend, who was in the same\nline of business, \"how long will it take Sir Snail to climb to the top of\nthe wall and descend the other side? The top of the wall, as you know,\nhas a sharp edge, so that when he gets there he will instantly begin to\ndescend, putting precisely the same exertion into his daily climbing down\nas he did in his climbing up, and sleeping and slipping at night as\nbefore.\"\n\nThis is the true version of the puzzle, and my readers will perhaps be\ninterested in working out the exact number of days. Of course, in a\npuzzle of this kind the day is always supposed to be equally divided into\ntwelve hours' daytime and twelve hours' night.", "answer": "At the end of seventeen days the snail will have climbed 17 ft., and at\nthe end of its eighteenth day-time task it will be at the top. It\ninstantly begins slipping while sleeping, and will be 2 ft. down the\nother side at the end of the eighteenth day of twenty-four hours. How\nlong will it take over the remaining 18 ft.? If it slips 2 ft. at night\nit clearly overcomes the tendency to slip 2 ft. during the daytime, in\nclimbing up. In rowing up a river we have the stream against us, but in\ncoming down it is with us and helps us. If the snail can climb 3 ft. and\novercome the tendency to slip 2 ft. in twelve hours' ascent, it could\nwith the same exertion crawl 5 ft. a day on the level. Therefore, in\ngoing down, the same exertion carries it 7 ft. in twelve hours--that is,\n5 ft. by personal exertion and 2 ft. by slip. This, with the night slip,\ngives it a descending progress of 9 ft. in the twenty-four hours. It can,\ntherefore, do the remaining 18 ft. in exactly two days, and the whole\njourney, up and down, will take it exactly twenty days."}
{"idx": 107, "title": "The Four Princes", "content": "The dominions of a certain Eastern monarch formed a perfectly square\ntract of country. It happened that the king one day discovered that his\nfour sons were not only plotting against each other, but were in secret\nrebellion against himself. After consulting with his advisers he decided\nnot to exile the princes, but to confine them to the four corners of the\ncountry, where each should be given a triangular territory of equal area,\nbeyond the boundaries of which they would pass at the cost of their\nlives. Now, the royal surveyor found himself confronted by great natural\ndifficulties, owing to the wild character of the country. The result was\nthat while each was given exactly the same area, the four triangular\ndistricts were all of different shapes, somewhat in the manner shown in\nthe illustration. The puzzle is to give the three measurements for each\nof the four districts in the smallest possible numbers--all whole\nfurlongs. In other words, it is required to find (in the smallest\npossible numbers) four rational right-angled triangles of equal area.", "answer": "When Montucla, in his edition of Ozanam's _Recreations in Mathematics_,\ndeclared that \"No more than three right-angled triangles, equal to each\nother, can be found in whole numbers, but we may find as many as we\nchoose in fractions,\" he curiously overlooked the obvious fact that if\nyou give all your sides a common denominator and then cancel that\ndenominator you have the required answer in integers!\n\nEvery reader should know that if we take any two numbers, _m_ and _n_,\nthen _m_^2 + _n_^2, _m_^2 - _n_^2, and _2mn_ will be the three sides of a\nrational right-angled triangle. Here _m_ and _n_ are called generating\nnumbers. To form three such triangles of equal area, we use the following\nsimple formula, where _m_ is the greater number:--\n\n  _mn_ + _m_^2 + _n_^2 = _a_\n  _m_^2 - _n_^2 = _b_\n  2_mn_ + _n_^2 = _c_\n\nNow, if we form three triangles from the following pairs of generators,\n_a_ and _b_, _a_ and _c_, _a_ and _b_ + _c_, they will all be of equal\narea. This is the little problem respecting which Lewis Carroll says in\nhis diary (see his _Life and Letters_ by Collingwood, p. 343), \"Sat up\nlast night till 4 a.m., over a tempting problem, sent me from New York,\n'to find three equal rational-sided right-angled triangles.' I found two\n... but could not find three!\"\n\nThe following is a subtle formula by means of which we may always find a\nR.A.T. equal in area to any given R.A.T. Let _z_ = hypotenuse, _b_ =\nbase, _h_ = height, _a_ = area of the given triangle; then all we have\nto do is to form a R.A.T. from the generators _z_^2 and 4_a_, and give\neach side the denominator 2_z_ (_b_^2 - _h_^2), and we get the required\nanswer in fractions. If we multiply all three sides of the original\ntriangle by the denominator, we shall get at once a solution in whole\nnumbers.\n\nThe answer to our puzzle in smallest possible numbers is as follows:--\n\n  First Prince ...  518   1320   1418\n  Second Prince ... 280   2442   2458\n  Third Prince ...  231   2960   2969\n  Fourth Prince ... 111   6160   6161\n\nThe area in every case is 341,880 square furlongs. I must here refrain\nfrom showing fully how I get these figures. I will explain, however, that\nthe first three triangles are obtained, in the manner shown, from the\nnumbers 3 and 4, which give the generators 37, 7; 37, 33; 37, 40. These\nthree pairs of numbers solve the indeterminate equation, _a_^3_b_\n-_b_^3_a_ = 341,880. If we can find another pair of values, the thing is\ndone. These values are 56, 55, which generators give the last triangle.\nThe next best answer that I have found is derived from 5 and 6, which\ngive the generators 91, 11; 91, 85; 91, 96. The fourth pair of values is\n63, 42.\n\nThe reader will understand from what I have written above that there is\nno limit to the number of rational-sided R.A.T.'s of equal area that may\nbe found in whole numbers."}
{"idx": 108, "title": "Plato and the Nines", "content": "Both in ancient and in modern times the number nine has been considered\nto possess peculiarly mystic qualities. We know, for instance, that there\nwere nine Muses, nine rivers of Hades, and that Vulcan was nine days\nfalling down from heaven. Then it has been confidently held that nine\ntailors make a man; while we know that there are nine planets, nine days'\nwonders, and that a cat has nine lives--and sometimes nine tails.\n\nMost people are acquainted with some of the curious properties of the\nnumber nine in ordinary arithmetic. For example, write down a number\ncontaining as many figures as you like, add these figures together, and\ndeduct the sum from the first number. Now, the sum of the figures in this\nnew number will always be a multiple of nine.\n\nThere was once a worthy man at Athens who was not only a cranky\narithmetician, but also a mystic. He was deeply convinced of the magic\nproperties of the number nine, and was perpetually strolling out to the\ngroves of Academia to bother poor old Plato with his nonsensical ideas\nabout what he called his \"lucky number.\" But Plato devised a way of\ngetting rid of him. When the seer one day proposed to inflict on him a\nlengthy disquisition on his favourite topic, the philosopher cut him\nshort with the remark, \"Look here, old chappie\" (that is the nearest\ntranslation of the original Greek term of familiarity): \"when you can\nbring me the solution of this little mystery of the three nines I shall\nbe happy to listen to your treatise, and, in fact, record it on my\nphonograph for the benefit of posterity.\"\nPlato then showed, in the manner depicted in our illustration, that three\nnines may be arranged so as to represent the number eleven, by putting\nthem into the form of a fraction. The puzzle he then propounded was so to\narrange the three nines that they will represent the number twenty.\n\nIt is recorded of the old crank that, after working hard at the problem\nfor nine years, he one day, at nine o'clock on the morning of the ninth\nday of the ninth month, fell down nine steps, knocked out nine teeth,\nand expired in nine minutes. It will be remembered that nine was his\nlucky number. It was evidently also Plato's.\n\nIn solving the above little puzzle, only the most elementary arithmetical\nsigns are necessary. Though the answer is absurdly simple when you see\nit, many readers will have no little difficulty in discovering it. Take\nyour pencil and see if you can arrange the three nines to represent\ntwenty.", "answer": "The following is the simple solution of the three nines puzzle:--\n\n  9 + 9\n  ----\n   .9\n\nTo divide 18 by .9 (or nine-tenths) we, of course, multiply by 10 and\ndivide by 9.

Neither player could ever win except\nthrough the blundering of his opponent. If Nought (the first player)\ntakes the centre, Cross must take a corner, or Nought may beat him with\ncertainty. If Nought takes a corner on his first play, Cross must take\nthe centre at once, or again be beaten with certainty.

{"idx": 110, "title": "Ovid's Game", "content": "Having examined \"Noughts and Crosses,\" we will now consider an extension\nof the game that is distinctly mentioned in the works of Ovid. It is, in\nfact, the parent of \"Nine Men's Morris,\" referred to by Shakespeare in _A\nMidsummer Night's Dream_ (Act ii., Scene 2). Each player has three\ncounters, which they play alternately on to the nine points shown in the\ndiagram, with the object of getting three in a line and so winning. But\nafter the six counters are played they then proceed to move (always to\nan adjacent unoccupied point) with the same object.

How many bullocks could I feed on a forty-acre field for six\nweeks, the grass growing regularly all the time?\"\n\nIt will be seen that the sting lies in the tail. That steady growth of\nthe grass is such a reasonable point to be considered, and yet to some\nreaders it will cause considerable perplexity. The grass is, of course,\nassumed to be of equal length and uniform thickness in every case when\nthe cattle begin to eat. The difficulty is not so great as it appears, if\nyou properly attack the question.", "answer": "Sir Isaac Newton has shown us, in his _Universal Arithmetic_, that we may\ndivide the bullocks in each case in two parts--one part to eat the\nincrease, and the other the accumulated grass. The first will vary\ndirectly as the size of the field, and will not depend on the time; the\nsecond part will also vary directly as the size of the field, and in\naddition inversely with the time. We find from the farmer's statements\nthat 6 bullocks keep down the growth in a 10-acre field, and 6 bullocks\neat the grass on 10 acres in 16 weeks. Therefore, if 6 bullocks keep down\nthe growth on 10 acres, 24 will keep down the growth on 40 acres.\n\nAgain, we find that if 6 bullocks eat the accumulated grass on 10 acres\nin 16 weeks, then\n\n   12 eat the grass on 10 acres in 8 weeks,\n   48  \"        \"      40   \"      8   \"\n  192  \"        \"      40   \"      2   \"\n   64  \"        \"      40   \"      6   \"\n\nAdd the two results together (24 + 64), and we find that 88 oxen may be\nfed on a 40-acre meadow for 6 weeks, the grass growing regularly all the\ntime."}
{"idx": 112, "title": "The Great Grangemoor Mystery", "content": "Mr. Stanton Mowbray was a very wealthy man, a reputed millionaire,\nresiding in that beautiful old mansion that has figured so much in\nEnglish history, Grangemoor Park. He was a bachelor, spent most of the\nyear at home, and lived quietly enough.\n\nAccording to the evidence given, on the day preceding the night of the\ncrime he received by the second post a single letter, the contents of\nwhich evidently gave him a shock. At ten o'clock at night he dismissed\nthe servants, saying that he had some important business matters to look\ninto, and would be sitting up late. He would require no attendance. It\nwas supposed that after all had gone to bed he had admitted some person\nto the house, for one of the servants was positive that she had heard\nloud conversation at a very late hour.\n\nNext morning, at a quarter to seven o'clock, one of the man-servants, on\nentering the room, found Mr. Mowbray lying on the floor, shot through the\nhead, and quite dead. Now we come to the curious circumstance of the\ncase. It was clear that after the bullet had passed out of the dead man's\nhead it had struck the tall clock in the room, right in the very centre\nof the face, and actually welded together the three hands; for the clock\nhad a seconds hand that revolved round the same dial as the hour and\nminute hands. But although the three hands had become welded together\nexactly as they stood in relation to each other at the moment of impact,\nyet they were free to revolve round the swivel in one piece, and had been\nstupidly spun round several times by the servants before Mr. Wiley Slyman\nwas called upon the spot. But they would not move separately.\nNow, inquiries by the police in the neighbourhood led to the arrest in\nLondon of a stranger who was identified by several persons as having been\nseen in the district the day before the murder, but it was ascertained\nbeyond doubt at what time on the fateful morning he went away by train.\nIf the crime took place after his departure, his innocence was\nestablished. For this and other reasons it was of the first importance to\nfix the exact time of the pistol shot, the sound of which nobody in the\nhouse had heard. The clock face in the illustration shows exactly how the\nhands were found. Mr. Slyman was asked to give the police the benefit of\nhis sagacity and experience, and directly he was shown the clock he\nsmiled and said:\n\n\"The matter is supremely simple. You will notice that the three hands\nappear to be at equal distances from one another. The hour hand, for\nexample, is exactly twenty minutes removed from the minute hand--that is,\nthe third of the circumference of the dial. You attach a lot of\nimportance to the fact that the servants have been revolving the welded\nhands, but their act is of no consequence whatever; for although they\nwere welded instantaneously, as they are free on the swivel, they would\nswing round of themselves into equilibrium. Give me a few moments, and I\ncan tell you beyond any doubt the exact time that the pistol was fired.\"\n\nMr. Wiley Slyman took from his pocket a notebook, and began to figure it\nout. In a few minutes he handed the police inspector a slip of paper, on\nwhich he had written the precise moment of the crime. The stranger was\nproved to be an old enemy of Mr. Mowbray's, was convicted on other\nevidence that was discovered; but before he paid the penalty for his\nwicked act, he admitted that Mr. Slyman's statement of the time was\nperfectly correct.\n\nCan you also give the exact time?", "answer": "We were told that the bullet that killed Mr. Stanton Mowbray struck the\nvery centre of the clock face and instantly welded together the hour,\nminute, and second hands, so that all revolved in one piece. The puzzle\nwas to tell from the fixed relative positions of the three hands the\nexact time when the pistol was fired.\n\nWe were also told, and the illustration of the clock face bore out the\nstatement, that the hour and minute hands were exactly twenty divisions\napart, \"the third of the circumference of the dial.\" Now, there are\neleven times in twelve hours when the hour hand is exactly twenty\ndivisions ahead of the minute hand, and eleven times when the minute hand\nis exactly twenty divisions ahead of the hour hand. The illustration\nshowed that we had only to consider the former case. If we start at four\no'clock, and keep on adding 1 h. 5 m. 27-3/11 sec., we shall get all\nthese eleven times, the last being 2 h. 54 min. 32-8/11 sec. Another\naddition brings us back to four o'clock. If we now examine the clock\nface, we shall find that the seconds hand is nearly twenty-two divisions\nbehind the minute hand, and if we look at all our eleven times we shall\nfind that only in the last case given above is the seconds hand at this\ndistance. Therefore the shot must have been fired at 2 h. 54 min. 32-8/11\nsec. exactly, or, put the other way, at 5 min. 27-3/11 sec. to three\no'clock. This is the correct and only possible answer to the puzzle."}
