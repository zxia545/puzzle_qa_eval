{"idx": 1, "title": "The Martian Rub", "content": "After his spaceship landed on Mars, astronaut Jonathan Mark disembarked and approached the first Martian he saw. 'Am I headed for the geological dig?\" he asked. The Martian rubbed his stomach. Mark knew that Martians could understand some Earth-talk, but were not able to speak it. And astronaut Mark, like so many Earthlings, could neither speak nor understand Martian gestures. He didn't know whether rubbing the stomach meant yes or no. But by asking one additional question, Mark was able to find out. What was that question?", "answer": "Mark rubbed his stomach and asked, \"Did you do this?\" Whatever the Martian did in reply would mean yes."}
{"idx": 2, "title": "Stone Stew", "content": "After astronaut Mark got to the dig, he collected rock specimens to take back to the Earth scientists. He packed the rocks into three sacks: one for igneous rocks, one for sedimentary and one for metamorphic. But, rushing to return to the aircraft before his portable oxygen ran out, he mislabelled all the sacks. How many rocks did he have to take out of how many sacks in order to find out what was in each one?", "answer": "One rock from one sack. If he were to open the sack labelled \"igneous,\" for instance, and the rock turned out to be sedimentary, then he would know that the other two sacks could not contain sedimentary rocks. The other sacks then would have either igneous or meta morphic rocks in them. Since all the sacks were mis labelled, the one labelled \"sedimentary\" must then con tain metamorphic and the one labelled \"metamorphic\" must contain igneous rocks. \"Stone Stew\" is not exactly a truth puzzle, but it is included because it does involve being misled. It points out the need for careful attention to the language of a puzzle. Most people are stuck until they reread it, and then they're amazed at how they could have had such trouble."}
{"idx": 3, "title": "Friend or Foe", "content": "Among the inhabitants of Mars were various kinds of creatures. One type was friendly to visitors from Earth and always told the truth. Another was hostile and always lied to Earthlings. But the astronauts couldn't tell the difference between them. 'Are you a truth-teller?\" astronaut John Armstrong asked a striped Martian he met on the way to the dig. \"He'll say, 'Yes,' \" commented a spotted Martian who was nearby. \"But he'll be lying.\" Who was the truth-teller, the striped Martian or the spotted one?", "answer": "The spotted Martian. Truth-teller or not, the striped Martian would answer yes. Why? If he were a truth-teller, obviously he would tell the truth and say yes. If he were a liar, he would lie and say yes. Therefore, since the spotted Martian said that the striped Martian would say yes, he must be the truth-teller, and the striped Martian must be the liar."}

So when she came face to face with three of them, she asked, 'Are you truth-tellers?\" The finned Martian answered her by rubbing his stomach. His friend, a tall Martian with feathered ears, told her that the finned Martian had said he was a truth-teller. However, the other Martian, who had horns, said that the finned Martian was lying. How many of these Martians were liars?", "answer": "How Many Liars? One. Since the finned Martian did indicate that he was a truth-teller, then the Martian with feathered ears was obviously telling the truth and must be a truth-teller. If the finned Martian was lying, then the horned Martian was a truth-teller. If the finned Martian was a truth-teller, then the horned Martian was a liar. So, no matter how you look at it, two of the three Martians were truth-tellers and one was a liar."}
{"idx": 5, "title": " The Search for Doman", "content": "This was astronaut Jose Perez's fourth visit to Mars and he had learned to speak Martian. He wanted to find his Martian friend Doman, but in order to locate him he had to know what group Doman belonged to. The three groups in the area were: Uti, Yomi, and Grundi. The Uti always told the truth. The Yomi always lied. The Grundi sometimes told the truth but sometimes lied. Perez needed information. Three Martians, Aken, Bal and Cwos, each of whom belonged to a different group, agreed to help him. He asked each one of them two questions: What group do you belong to? What group does Doman belong to? 1. Aken said: I am not a Uti. Doman is a Yomi. 2. Bal said: I am not a Yomi. Doman is a Grundi. 3. Cwos said: I am not a Grundi. Doman is a Uti. What group does Doman belong to?", "answer": "He is a Uti. 1. Aken said he was not a Uti. If he were a Uti, he couldn't say he was not one since Uti always tell the truth. So he is definitely not a Uti. If he were a Yomi he couldn't say he was not a Uti since that would be the truth and the Yomi always lie. So he cannot be a Yomi. Therefore, Aken is a Grundi who sometimes tells the truth and sometimes lies. And so we still don't know what group Doman belongs to. 2. Bal said he was not a Yomi. But is he a lying Yomi or a truth-telling Uti? We don't know yet. 3. Cwos said he was not a Grundi. Since each of the three Martians belongs to a different group, and we already know that Aken is the only Grundi among them, Cwos must be telling the truth. Therefore Cwos is a Uti. 4. It follows that Bal must be a Yomi, because he lied by denying that he is a Yomi. 5. Since Cwos is the truth-teller, Doman must be a Uti because Cwos said he is."}
{"idx": 6, "title": "Martian Mystery", "content": "There was trouble from the Grundi. One of them damaged the spaceship by hurling a rock at it. The astronauts couldn't figure out what the Grundi had to gain by their hostile act. Was it just vandalism, done out of sheer spite? Or perhaps not everyone on Mars was happy to see the Earthlings return. The Martian police chief brought in five Grundi for questioning. Like all Grundi, they sometimes told the truth and sometimes lied. The suspects each made three statements, two of which were true and one of which was false. And the guilty one was revealed. 1. Zum said: I am innocent. I have never used a rock to destroy anything. Tset did it. 2. Uk said: I did not do the damage. The Earthman's vehicle is on Grundi space. Yan is not my friend. 3. Pala said: I am innocent. I never saw Yan before. Tset is guilty. 4. Tset said: I did not throw the rock. Yan did it. Zum did not tell the truth when he said I did it. 5. Yan said: I am innocent. Uk is guilty. Pala and I are old friends. Who was the culprit?", "answer": "Uk. 1. Tset said (in his first statement) that he did not throw the rock and (in his third statement) that Zum lied by saying he, Tset, did. Since only one of the three state ments could be false, both of these must be true. There fore, his second statement that Yan did it must be a lie. So, we know that both Tset and Yan are innocent. 2. Zum said that Tset did it, and so we know that this statement is Zum's one lie. Therefore, Zum's statement, \"I am innocent,\" is the truth. Who is left as a possible culprit? Pala and Uk. 3. Since Tset is innocent, Pala's comment that Tset did it was her lie. Therefore, her statements that she was in nocent and that she never saw Yan before were true. 4. Yan's assertion that he and Pala were old friends was therefore a lie. He told the truth when he said that he, Yan, was innocent and that Uk was guilty."}

Since Bal debated with the Yomi, she could be a Uti, a Grundi or a Rafi. But she debated and fought with the blue-feathered Martian, the Rafi, and the brown, the Uti. Therefore, she must be the red-feathered Grundi.```markdown|       | Uti | Grundi | Yomi | Rafi ||-------|-----|--------|------|------|| Aken  | N   |        |      |      || Bal   | N   | Y      | N    | N    || Mun   | N   | N      |      | Y    || Wora  | N   | N      | Y    | N    |```12. Even before we learned that Bal had red feathers, we knew from 3 that Wora was not the red-feathered Grundi. In 3, we are also told that Wora and the Rafi admired the brown-feathered Martian. So Wora is neither the brown-feathered Uti nor the blue-feathered Rafi. She must be a green-feathered Yomi.13. Mun is therefore the Rafi, the one in blue feathers."}

{"idx": 17, "title": "Royal Dinner", "content": "To enlist the help of the other kingdoms, the king talked to the queen about inviting neighboring royalty to dinner. This put the queen into a royal snit. Theirs was not a very wealthy kingdom and the royal dinnerware was in a disgraceful condition. Apart from ordinary dishes for everyday use, all that the royal pantry contained were a few dinner plates of three different dinner patterns: 1. five silver ones with birds 2. six crystal with seashells 3. seven gold with the royal crest They were all stored in disarray on a very dark top shelf of the royal pantry. Only those would be suitable for entertaining other royalty. If the queen didn't want to climb up to the top shelf twice, how many dinner plates would she have to take down to be sure she had matching dinner plates for herself, her royal spouse, and for the neighboring king and queen?

In order to ensure matching plates, the queen had to bring down three extra plates, one for each pattern, for each person more than two. The formula: N + 1 + N(X) (with N representing the number of patterns or types and X representing the number of people more than two). The queen had three patterns of plates and so N = 3. In addition to the king and queen, there were two guests, and so X = 2. 3 + 1 + 3(2) = 10. Try it and you will find that for three persons the queen would have needed to take down seven plates, and for five she would have had to take down 13 plates. If her children had not been out ogre-fighting, the royal queen might have had to mix and match! "}

Heads for Hats: Yes, they went free. Paula was wearing a white hat.Princess Paula thought it through this way:1. If both Benjamin and I are wearing red hats, Abel would know that he is wearing a white hat because there are only two red hats.2. Benjamin knows from Abels confusion that either he or I or both of us are wearing a white hat.3. Benjamin sees the color of my hat, but he still doesnt know what color hat he is wearing.4. If my hat is red, Benjamin would know his own hat is white.5. Therefore, my hat is white.No matter how many princes and princesses are captured, as long as the number of hats of one color is one less than the number of prisoners, at least one of them will always have a hat of the other color.

Condition 8 is obviously impossible because there are only two red hats.2. We can eliminate condition 3 when Abel cannot tell the color of his hat. Since there were only two red hats, he would have known he had a white one if the other two wore red.3. We can eliminate condition 7 because Benjamin could not tell the color of his hat. If the other two were wearing red, he would have known he was wearing white.4. We can eliminate condition 2. If Paulas hat had been red, Benjamin would have known his own hat was white since both hats could not have been red.5. In every other condition, Paulas hat is white."}
